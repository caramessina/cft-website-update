  <h1>Critical Fan Pedagogy</h1>
  <p>Much of this dissertation has defined critical fan practices and uptakes, examining overall trends in two fandoms as well as speaking with fans who incorporate critical fan practices in their work. For instructors working with students everyday, how can we bring these themes and ideas into traditional classroom? What is critical fan pedagogy? What may some assignments or a syllabus look like? How can we assess writers’ critical fan practices in the classroom? What challenges may we run into? </p>

  <h2>Critical Fan Pedagogy Sections</h2>
  <p>This portion of the toolkit—or "chapter" in a dissertation-friendly context—has three main section, and depending on your intentions and positionality, you can choose to navigate which appeals to you.</p>

      <h3>Defining Critical Fan Pedaogy</h3>
      <p>This section introduces critical fan pedagogy, which can be incorporated in both traditional classroom settings or as a “self-pedagogy” as mentioned by Eric Darnell Pritchard (2018). Specifically, this section will look at fan and pedagogy scholars who discuss forms of fan and critical pedagogy to merge the different praxis and approaches.</p>

      <h3>CFP Resources For Instructors</h3>
      <p>This section shares a list of teaching materials, from a critical fan syllabus, to assignments, to hands-on activities, that can be incorporated in the classroom. Because these resources are published, you are welcome to use them (with citations, of course) and scale them as needed based on classroom context.</p>

        <h3>CFP Resources For Fans</h3>
        <p>This section provides outlines recommendations and approaches for critical fan pedagogy. There are some important readings, both academic and popular culture sources, but also specific practices and questions you may take up in your everyday work. These suggestions are based on the analysis (AO3 data and interviews) conducted in this project.</p>

<h2>CFP Definition</h2>
<p><strong>Critical fan pedagogy</strong> cultivates and strengthens critical awareness through fans' participation in fan genres and communities. This participation is a form of praxis, or the embodiment of theory in practice; praxis is central to fan communities, as there are fan politics and theories that shape community building and participation. Through these critical social actions, fans can actively resist hegemonic and often oppressive ideologies that appear across mainstream cultural materials as well as the very communities in which they participate. In other words, we look to fan practices to define critical fan pedagogy; we look to the work they are always-already creating to better understand how these practices are, in fact, pedagogical.</p>
<p>Pedagogy, in its simplest definition, are the methods and theory that drive teaching and learning. Every teacher has their own pedagogy, some which are explicit and some which are implicit. While pedagogy is mainly discussed in the context of a classroom, teaching and learning does not need to stop there. As <a href="http://www.siupress.com/books/978-0-8093-3554-1">Eric Darnell Prtichard (2018) demonstrates in his book <cite>Fashioning Lives: Black Queers and the Politics of Literacy</cite></a>, self pedagogy is an essential method for people—particularly marginalized folks—to learn how to navigate social and political systems, especially when those systems are not designed for them. Pritchard specifically points to "restorative literacies," or literacy development practices that are a form of self-pedagogy. He introduces self-pedagogy as an essential area for himself, and more generally Black queer folks, who face different forms of oppression based on their race, sexuality, and gender expression; they learned to navigate different resources available, find or build communities, become political activists, and/or be critical of larger systems that excluded them.
