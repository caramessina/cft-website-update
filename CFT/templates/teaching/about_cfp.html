  <h1>About Critical Fan Pedagogy</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>Critical fan pedagogy</strong> centers cultivating and strengthening critical awareness by engaging in fan genres and communities. Through critical social actions, fans can actively resist hegemonic and often oppressive ideologies that appear across mainstream cultural materials as well as the very communities in which they participate. In other words, we look to fan practices to define critical fan pedagogy; we look to the work they are always-already creating to better understand how these practices are, in fact, pedagogical.</p>
    <p>Eric Darnell Pritchard refers to forms of literacy education outside of traditional classroom settings as “self-pedagogy.” For Pritchard, this self-pedagogy is particularly important for queer Black folks, who navigate heteronormative, homophobic, and racist institutions. For the folks Pritchard interviewed and in his analysis of archival materials, forms of self-pedagogy were crucial to navigating everyday life, community and identity formation, and understanding the self in relation to a larger culture and society.</p>
    <p>Fandoms demonstrate a form of self-pedagogy, or as Paul Booth argues, fandoms are the “classroom of the future.” Fandoms are spaces where fans analyze different media and creatively reimagine or transform aspects of that media. Specifically, Booth refers to fans’ critical thinking practices around hegemonic cultures. Hegemonic cultures refers to the normalized narratives--tropes, people and stories who are represented, and how these representations reflect ideas around gender, race, sexuality, and other aspects of identity and positionality--that permeate cultural materials, specifically mainstream cultural materials. Analyzing hegemonic cultures relies on an understanding of what is mainstream as well as why it may be mainstream. While mainstream trends often change, there are underlying historical, political, and ideological patterns that emerge.</p>
    <p>One glaring ideological thread is the role of white supremacy. In most cultural media, white supremacy is the norm: main characters or heroes are usually white, while sidekicks, supportive friend, and even villain roles are filled by actors of color. By recognizing the hegemonic ideologies that dominate these mainstream cultures, fans can begin to resist these ideologies in their own fan composing practices. However, this effort needs to be conscious and decisive. For those who know <em>Game of Thrones</em> well, the white supremacy and glorification of White, Western cultures is glaring; simply looking at who lives, who dies, who the heroes are, and who barely gets screen time demonstrates these racial and ethnic values. White supremacy, however,  does not begin or end in the context of the show. The show was created in a larger cultural context, a culture that celebrates whiteness. As the <a href="/fanfic_data/fandom_by_numbers"><em>Game of Thrones</em> data analysis results demonstrate</a>, white supremacy in the GoT fandom, or the focus on white characters, mirrors the white supremacy in the show. While fandoms can be the classroom of the future, as Booth argues, fan scholars and fans must acknowledge the ways in which systems of oppression are replicated and entangled in fan communities. How, then, can critical fan pedagogy teach fans and writers to resist these dominant and often violent ideologies, when these ideologies may be present in their own communities and even their own work?</p>

    <p>Turning to fan scholars who heavily center critical race theory and racial literacies demonstrates the ways in which fans resist white supremacy as well as other systems of oppression. Ebony Elizabeth Thomas and Amy Stornaiuolo (2016) construct a taxonomy for “restorying,” which they define as “reshaping narratives to better reflect a diversity of perspectives and experiences...an act of asserting the importance of one’s experience in a world that tries to silence subaltern voices” (p. 314). They provide six methods of restorying: transforming time, place, perspective, mode, metanarrative, and character identity. For many fan scholars, identity-bending is one of the most heralded forms of critical fan practices. andré carrington (2012) argues that fan composing practices can be critical forms of reception. He specifically looks at racebending, when a fan transforms the race of a character--usually a white character, as a form of criticism.</p>

    <p>Forms of identity-bending and restorying are not enough, though. Consider a classroom, where there are a diversity of perspectives. Does a white student racebending a white character demonstrate the same critical prowess as a Black student racebending a white character? When are forms of identity bending empowering, and when can they potentially falter and reify problematic representations of people of color? </p>

    <p>In critical fan pedagogy, representation itself is not enough. Critical fans expose themselves to fan theorizing and fan activism, understanding how their own representations can either subvert or reify systems of oppression. Critical fans often are doing this theorizing already, both by reading academic theory and engaging with other critical fans on Twitter, Tumblr, and other fan platforms centered around discussion. Critical fans, as fandoms, thrive in communities that center justice, antiracism, and queerness. This next section will discuss pillars of critical pedagogy and how these pillars may be applied to critical fan pedagogy. </p>

  <h2>Critical Pedagogy</h2>
  <p>I turn to critical pedagogy to specify how critical fan pedagogies may develop and the types of theorizing and praxis needed for fans interested in developing their critical practices as well as instructors interested in incorporating critical fan pedagogies. Critical pedagogy stems from Paulo Freire’s term conscientização, or critical consciousness. Brazil’s political landscape radially transformed in the 1960s under the Fifth Brazilian Republic; Freire, a political exile, was teaching adult learners about literacy, heavily focusing on developing their critical consciousness. The goal of conscientização is to empower those who are oppressed to liberate themselves from the constraints imposed by the oppressors; Freire refers to this as prescription:</p>
  <blockquote>“Every prescription represents the imposition of one individual’s choice upon another, transforming the consciousness of the person prescribed to into one that conforms with the prescriber's consciousness. Thus, the behavior of the oppressed is a prescribed behavior, following as it does the guidelines of the oppressor” (p. 46).</blockquote>
  <p>One of his main methods helping learners develop their critical consciousness was to implement a dialogic, horizontal pedagogy, rather than a top-down education. He did not want to teach learners how to do something, but rather demonstrate how theorizing can transform perspectives and potentially break prescribed behavior. Freire’s radical pedagogy is one that permeates through disciplines like rhetoric, composition, communication, education, and literacy studies. </p>
  <p>bell hooks (1994) extends--and critiques--Freire’s work, addressing both the phallocentrism of his language and perspective, while also valuing the power of his work. She acknowledges a connection between the people Freire taught and many Americans, specifically Black Americans. For hooks, Freire not only theorized, but embodied his theories through praxis, or the interdependent relationship between theory and practice. hooks’ Black feminist pedagogy centers theory as a liberatory practice. For hooks, theorizing is not enough; feminist theory, she argues, can be impenetrable or represent only one particular point of view in order to “fit in” with academic elitism and intellectualism. The value of theory, especially for Black women who are often critiqued by elitist cultures, is the <em>liberatory practice</em> of which theory can pave the path. In her pedagogy, hooks prioritizes community development, love, hope, and representation. She hopes to develop critical consciousness, focusing specifically on Black feminist practices and Black women.</p>

  <h2>Critical Fan Pedagogy Pillars</h2>
  <p>Freire and hooks’ pedagogies value several actions: dialogue, love, community-building, and representation. The goal embedded with all of these approaches is to develop critical consciousness, whether that criticism is of larger tyrannical government (Freire) or the more insidious racism and misogyny that enacts violence upon marginalized folks (hooks). However, each of these actions can be directly translated to critical fan practices.
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dialogue.</strong> Every fan is familiar with the role of dialogue in fandoms. Dialogue may be everything from Twitter conversations, to reposting something on Tumblr, to conversations in a hall at a convention, to discussions between friends. Dialogue centralizes a back-and-forth exchange of ideas, and how this exchange builds extensive fandom knowledge and analysis. Discussions, as pointed out by several of the fans interviewed for this dissertation, often analyze the cultural material. Forms of analysis will differ depending on the community the fan is a part of. For example, Kittya shares the tensions in the Supergirl fandom around Kara and Lena’s potential romance; Kittya says she and other like-minded, critical fans recognize their potential budding, queer relationship, while other fans argue that this is a glaring misinterpretation. While these dialogues can be difficult to happen, especially when anger and frustration is involved, they need to happen. Dialoguing, of course, is not enough; a critical dialogue requires listening and attempting to understand another point of view. The question then becomes how can critical fans dialogue? </li>
    <li><strong>Love in action.</strong>What does love in action look like? As a student once asked me, “who the heck would spend so much time writing 100,000 words based on a cartoon?”, and it was a fair question. Taking the time to write 100,000 words is not easy, especially if there is no financial compensation. So why do fanfiction writers do it? How can they do it? This, I argue, is love in action. hooks’ focus on love prioritizes feminist praxis, specifically an ethics of care, into her pedagogy; she teaches, writes, and leads with compassion, and hopes her students and readers do the same. One of the running theories in fan studies is the importance of love in fandoms. Joanna Russ’ 1985 essay, “Pornography by women for women, with love,” one of the earliest fan studies essays, emphasizes the acts of love taken in fanfiction and fan zine composition. These labors of love, often uncompensated, drive fan communities and motivate fans to compose. Fans not only love the characters and stories from the original cultural material, but love the different genres in fandoms. Fanfiction is not necessarily about the cultural materials, but the actual practices of writing fanfiction and connecting with others. In several of the <a href="{{ url_for('interviews') }}""> interviews conducted for this project</a>, critical fans gushed over their love for the cultural material, how they related to the narrative, and also the ways in which they connected with their friends through their mutual love. It is through the action of love that critical fans may also be able to bridge anger and resentment, such as the tensions mentioned above in the Supergirl fandom. Love in action is one of the most difficult pillars of critical fan pedagogy, though, as it requires patience, forgiveness, and listening, even when the other party may purposefully uncritical.</li>
    <li><strong>Community-Building.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Representation</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>These actions stem from critical and feminist pedagogies. However, there are fan pedagogies that extend these actions or demonstrate specific ways in which these actions occur.</p>
