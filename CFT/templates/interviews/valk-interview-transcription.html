<h2>Interview</h2>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Okay so today on January 22, 2020, I am
            interviewing Valk.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Hi, I'm Valk and I've consented to give my voice
            and image, if need be, for recording.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great, thank you. We'll start off by talking a
            little bit about yourself and I'm going to ask you a few questions about you as a fan
            fiction writer and some of the work that you've produced. Can you tell me a little bit
            about yourself as a writer, a fan fiction writer? When did you start? Which fandoms did
            you start with? How do you participate in the fan communities and how has that
            participation changed over the years?</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Well, definitely I started young. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk001')">I started writing and initially my own fan fic, so self insert fan
                fic when I was like maybe about 10 years old.<span class="popuptext" id="valk001">Code: genre-other</span></span></span> Then I kind of gradually
            transferred over to an online community. Initially a very small, now defunct, anime
            website that was collecting anime fan fiction and then it transferred over to
            fanfiction.net. Then, as my fandoms changed, I was mainly into anime. I took a break
            after I left high school and then I started writing different types of fan fiction,
            series, mainly Game of Thrones as the big one. It changed mainly along the lines of what
            scenes I was trying to tackle. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk002')">Of course, being
                younger, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk062')">you don't really understand romance all
                    typically well. It's all very idealized.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk062">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span> Then as I got older, I
                started liking to delve more into different types of friendships as well.<span class="popuptext" id="valk002">Code: reflection</span></span></span> I
            haven't really done very much writing recently. I've been quite busy in real life, so
            it's kind of tapered off over the years, but it was definitely a tool I used to sort of
            work through also my own stuff as well.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome, thank you. Do you mind talking a
            little bit about what your own stuff is that you were working through?</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk003')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk063')">I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
                    to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
                    bi-sexual.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk063">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> I used it sort of as a tool in some fan fics to work
                through ideas or feelings that I'd had and didn't know how to properly verbalize
                yet. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk064')">I was putting them on paper, using another
                    character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
                    where I felt I was kind of safe to do so.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk064">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> I didn't always
                publish all of them, but the one that you contacted me over, I did,
                obviously.<span class="popuptext" id="valk003">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great, thank you. So you said that you haven't
            really been writing as much fan fiction recently, but have you produced anything as of
            late in regards to fan fiction or anything on fandoms?</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Recently, in terms of fandoms, I was doing some
            stuff with The Witcher that recently came out. I played the video games back in 2017 and
            so when the new show came out, I was very excited to share everything with my friends.
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk004')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk065')">Mainly regarding the pairings that would
                    show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
                    just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
                    not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
                    female-female relationships as well<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk065">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span>, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk066')">because a lot of the media already does a lot of
                    the male-female exploration.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk066">Systems of Power: heteronormativity</span></span></span> And a lot of the purpose of fandom
                is to sort of explore beyond what we're just given.<span class="popuptext" id="valk004">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, critical-uptake</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. Sorry, just writing this
            down.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great, thank you. With your fan fiction, I was
            wondering if you could talk and describe a little bit of your motivation behind writing,
            Painting Works of Art?</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk005')">Yeah, I wrote it in
                one sitting in a Starbucks near my university.<span class="popuptext" id="valk005">Code: drafting</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk006')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk067')">It was around the
                    time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk067">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> and
                I tried to sort of work things out with Jaime as the main focal character<span class="popuptext" id="valk006">Code: motivation</span></span></span>
            because in Game of Thrones itself, when they delve into the background of Cersei, it's
            all through Cersei's chapters that you hear about what also happened with Jaime. There
            was a part in the back story where Cersei convinced Jaime, because Jaime was a bit of a
            tool, to trade places with them. So, she was the one going to sword practices and
            learning manly things and he was the one going to her sewing classes and sitting by the
            fire doing needlework and stuff. And that was really interesting, but because it was all
            from the point of view of Cersei and she cares about Jaime, but in so far as what he's
            able to provide for her because of that kind of dysfunctional relationship. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk007')">You never
                really hear about what Jaime thought about it. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk068')">I sort of delved into this idea trying to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
                    with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
                    wanted to be able to relate to it as well.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk068">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="valk007">Code: implicit-explicit, modern-setting identity-bending</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. Can you talk a little bit about some
            of the strengths you think are in this fic?</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk008')">My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
                Jamie and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
                because <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk069')">obviously they wouldn't be having as
                    much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
                    considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
                    day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
                    from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
                    versa.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk069">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span> There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
                wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
                identity. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk070')">But there would definitely be some push
                    back,<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk070">Systems of Power: sexism</span></span></span> but how would that change based on the setting?
            <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk071')">I made her a little bit more comfortable in
                her skin than Jaime<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk071">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span> and <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk072')">also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive shoulder for Jaime
                    who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
                    well.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk072">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="valk008">Code: important-quote, canon-resistant, modern-setting identity-bending, reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great, thank you. Can you talk a little bit
            about some of the challenges you face? You started to sort of get into the challenges
            you faced.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk009')">Yeah, definitely when it comes to trying to write it
                realistically as well, but the banter back and forth was very difficult. I read a
                lot of fan fic where it can be very stalkish and when I think about it and I think
                about someone saying it out loud, I just like cringe. My face caves in.<span class="popuptext" id="valk009">Code: fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span>
            Writing it realistically and <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk010')">writing it also based off
                of <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk073')">my own experiences, just exploring the LGBT
                    community in my area<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk073">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span>, I was kind of writing it from that
                perspective, but also not having as much information as I would like. <span class="popuptext" id="valk010">Code: reflection</span></span></span>I
            wasn't as versed in it. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk011')">That, and also trying to write
                and finish an entire fan fic in one sitting is very difficult when it's in a public
                setting. Luckily, it happened and it was a nice exercise as well, just also to be
                able to sit and write and have it really done in one sitting and then put it out
                there was very satisfying.<span class="popuptext" id="valk011">Code: drafting</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Did you revise it at all before you published
            it or did you sit down and write it and then just immediately publish it?</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk012')">I did a very brief
                look over and then I was like, "Screw it,"<span class="popuptext" id="valk012">Code: revising</span></span></span> and I put it online and then I
            walked away for a day because I just get nervous hovering over it. So, I'm like close
            the tab, don't come back for a day.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. Okay. I want to ask a little bit about
            some of the feedback you received from this.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk013')">Yeah, I got a very
                interesting response from someone. I believe, maybe a week or two after. They were
                like, "It's a really well written fan fic, it's great, but why in God's (capital G)
                name, did you make Jaime like this?" And the moment I saw capital G, I was like I
                see. I tried to be as cordial as I could and I explained what I said earlier about
                my inspiration<span class="popuptext" id="valk013">Code: reception</span></span></span> coming <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk014')">from the source material where I wanted to kind of
                explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
                because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
                as well.<span class="popuptext" id="valk014">Code: implicit-explicit, modern-setting</span></span></span> That's when he kind of stops being such a tool and starts actually
            trying to act for himself and do things for himself, rather than taking suggestions and
            kind of following this promised path that he was supposed to be given that never made
            him any happier. It was definitely a story line that I related to a lot, so I wanted to
            especially do that. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk015')">Yeah, that was the one big kick
                back I got from someone. I was a little bit shocked that I got the capital G person,
                but what can you do?<span class="popuptext" id="valk015">Code: reception</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, it's like you have specific
            tags.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Yeah, you could have avoided this.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Speaking of tags actually, so that's how I
            found your piece. You used the tags, obviously, alternate universe, modern setting,
            gender fluid character, gender issues, non-sexual intimacy for your fic. Why did you
            decide to use these particular tags?</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Well, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk016')">I wanted to actually put some Game
                of Thrones content on those tags to begin with because back when I was writing it,
                there wasn't a lot really going for it. LGBT fan fics, yeah sure, but
            <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk074')">gender fluid and gender
                    related things, it wasn't really there.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk074">Systems of Power: homophobia-transphobia</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="valk016">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, critical-uptake</span></span></span> Gender issues,
            in particular, I found a lot of characters had potential that you could explore, Brienne
            being one of the biggest ones. I didn't see a lot really on there either because I'm
            talking a lot about Jaime, but also Brienne's in the fic as well to sort of be the
            opposite end of where Jaime is and looking to get people to relate, to be the character
            and person that he needs in order to take this step forward to sort of be a guiding
            hand. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk017')">While I do ship them together romantically, I
                wanted to write something that also reflected that you could do like a very intimate
                moment without bring sex into it as well.<span class="popuptext" id="valk017">Code: reflection</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk018')">I feel for them, a<span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk075')"> lot of their fics also had a lot of like Jaime
                    being the man and Brienne finally being able to let her guard
                    down.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk075">Systems of Power: heteronormativity</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="valk018">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span> A lot of Jaime's relationship with Brienne is him
            finally letting a lot of his guard down and him finally being able to be the person that
            he wanted to be while Brienne had been the cause of all this. Because she was already
            there, she was already doing everything she wanted to do and she was experiencing a lot
            of kick back for it, but seeing her do that made Jaime feel like, "What the hell am I
            doing? I should be able to do this too." <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk019')">It's
                something that I wanted to, again, wanted to bring into a fan fic to kind of make it
                more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and
                wondering the same thing.<span class="popuptext" id="valk019">Code: audience motivation</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk020')">Like, where is this content that
                should be out there because it's in the books and why is no one taking this up and
                writing about it?<span class="popuptext" id="valk020">Code: fan-politics, critical-uptake</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. Sorry, I'm just going to take one
            second to finish my notes.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Yeah, no worries.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you for going into sort of such a
            thorough explanation of the tags. That's really helpful. I'm going to just sort of move
            away from the sub questions because I feel like you sort of tackled those well, unless
            there's actually any other tags that you might put on this text now that you've sort of
            had some time away from it.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk021')">I think I would want to go
                more into maybe tagging some of the triggers maybe now a days because back then
                there wasn't as much of a discussion around it. Now a days, you have more of a
                discussion around what bigger tags to put in to help people avoid it for instance.
                Now that AO3 has updated its tagging system to include and exclude.<span class="popuptext" id="valk021">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span> Back
            then, it was like if you want to find this fic, here are the ones you can search for, so
            that would probably be the ones I would want to add later on.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Awesome. You've talked about it quite a
            bit at this point, but I was wondering if you could spend a little bit more time talking
            about why you decided to focus on Jaime and Brienne and specifically why you decided to
            depict their relationship in the way that you did, especially sort of in the modern
            setting as their roommates and all that.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk022')">It was part of
                actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
                how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
                how she had gotten to living with Jaime.<span class="popuptext" id="valk022">Code: modern-setting</span></span></span> More than anything, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk023')">I just find their relationship in
                    canon to be so interesting because <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk076')">it was one of
                    the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
                    pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
                    surprised.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk076">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="valk023">Code: canon-compliment, implicit-explicit</span></span></span> More likely than not, I just end up not
            really being invested in them very much, but this one, they both revolutionized how each

                these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
                places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
                and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk077')">I think that reflected a lot of her issues with not being able
                    to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
                    heir, giving him a son and all these things.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk077">Systems of Power: sexism</span></span></span> And there might be
                always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
                gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable<span class="popuptext" id="valk024">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span>. He
            never really learned to sort of speak for himself, not really speak for himself, but he
            was following the family plan and he never questioned it and he had never said, "Would I
            be happier doing something else?" And Brienne was the answer to that. Just like how
            their banter was and how their relationship developed and how it's come to be. Again,
            I've never had a pairing where I was like, "I don't care if they're romantically
            involved or not." I just like seeing them together, in the same room and bantering and
            eating together. And I wanted to focus more, I guess, on a friendship aspect. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk025')">There's a lot of, again, fan fic already out there of

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great, thank you. I'm going to ask you a little
            bit about some specific choices in the text and sort of walk through. I really enjoyed
            reading this piece a lot, I just want to say, so I had lots of questions, sort of
            specific moments and quotes. My first question is why did you decide to write sort of a
            one shot, focusing on this particular moment for Jaime and Brienne? You know, Jaime
            going into the makeup store, him buying the pallette that completed his trifecta and
            then Brienne helping him put it on.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk026')">I guess I wanted to
                get a very powerful moment on paper. I had all these ideas and notes about what was
                also going on in the universe and what not, but this was the one that kind of
                started it. I wanted to make sure that I could get it down and not have it be that
                fan fic that I write in my head and then I just cannot put on paper later on.<span class="popuptext" id="valk026">Code: drafting</span></span></span>

                    it.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk080">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> Definitely.<span class="popuptext" id="valk027">Code: motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Awesome. There is a quote sort of
            towards the beginning when Jaime goes to the makeup store that says, "He swallowed.
            Makeup was nothing you should toy with. He agreed with them silently." Can you talk a
            little bit more about this moment?</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Yeah, it was like, I think for him also going into
            more about like the unseen background story for Jaime is that he was in fencing in
            university before he lost his hand and he sort of saw makeup as something along the
            lines, like a weapon you should treat with respect. So he was kind of carrying over that
            cutter mentality to it. Also, growing up with Cersei, he also would have had exposure to
            makeup already being the twin, of course, but <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk028')">even in the context of like the canon,
                <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk081')">he always had a very strange affinity, but
                    like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
                    loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
                    of view.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk081">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="valk028">Code: canon-compliment, implicit-explicit</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk029')">I think he definitely
                is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
                means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
                it.<span class="popuptext" id="valk029">Code: implicit-explicit, reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Sort of continuation of the scene of him
            in the makeup store, you write, 'Jaime tried to look disinterested in the products
            around him, to look like the lost boyfriend trying to remember what his girlfriend told
            him to buy.' I was really interested in this moment. Why does Jaime sort of perform in
            this way?</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk030')">I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
            way and being very new, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk082')">if you're very new into
                    like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
                    a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
                    higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
                    or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
                    You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
                anything.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk082">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="valk030">Code: identity-bending, reflection</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk031')">That's definitely
                something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
                of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
                would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
                more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
                me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
                anything like that. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk084')">Residual toxic masculinity and
                    all of that.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk084">Systems of Power: sexism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="valk031">Code: implicit-explicit, modern-setting</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> It never leaves. Okay. This brings me to my
            next question which is really a great segue way. Can you talk more about how you
            imagined Jaime's relationship with his father? You have sort of a few moments where you
            bring in his relationship with his father and how he affected his
            perspective.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk032')">Yeah, so at the
                same time I was writing this fan fic, I was writing another one that kind of delved
                into the timeline of how Jaime grew up.<span class="popuptext" id="valk032">Code: drafting</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk033')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk085')">It went
                    into his relationship with his father, he was caught walking in his mother's red
                    heels and he got very scolded and punished for it.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk085">Systems of Power: heteronormativity</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="valk033">Code: reflection</span></span></span> He
            didn't understand why at the time, and then looking back, he kind of understood and knew
            to hide it more. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk034')">I wanted
                to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
                in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
                that Tywin was a very controlling father.<span class="popuptext" id="valk034">Code: canon-compliant, modern-setting</span></span></span> He wanted to have Jaime be his
            heir. He was kind of molding Jaime for that kind of role to make sure, you know, never
            show your full hand, always have a backup plan, always try and read and understand other
            people and have something against them, just in case. Tywin's method of socializing and
            forming relationships was very much a game of chess to him. Regardless of what kind of
            relationship it was, he had to have the upper hand and be able to win it, even if it's
            not visibly the upper hand. He wanted to always have that ability to and he would pass
            that on to Jaime. This is all taking place after his relationship with Tywin broke down
            and he's living away from them, with Brienne. There's still prices of that and how he's
            still finds himself doing things that his father had taught him to do and he had picked
            up on from his father, just naturally. He's aware of it and then just trying to break
            from him is difficult.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. My next question is sort of about the
            interaction between Brienne and Jaime about his prosthetic and his disability and that
            interaction. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about that.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk035')">This is a topic
            that I was a little bit hesitant to tackle because at the time, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk086')">when I was writing, I wasn't very well-versed in
                    not just having a limb missing as a disability, but also how advanced the
                    prosthetics were and if they could hold things<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk086">Systems of Power: abelism disability</span></span></span>. I did a little
                bit of research while I was at Starbucks, trying to sort of complete
                everything.<span class="popuptext" id="valk035">Code: research</span></span></span> There was some, but again, you're using a lot of rotation and
            what not, so if theoretically he could have done it, but he has such a high standard. If
            he was able to fail, it would have been so much worse, so he wanted someone who had a
            more practiced hand with it. I didn't really delve too much into it, asides from the
            mention of when he needed someone to put on the eyeliner because he had been
            right-handed. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk036')">If I were to do this fic over again or
                update it or add on to it, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk087')">I would definitely
                    want to go more into his disability as well as his prosthetic and how it worked
                    more.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk087">Systems of Power: disability</span></span></span> Things like that to sort of flush it out more because I
                don't think in the fic I didn't do the best job I could at it. It was sort of
                something I tried to fill out as much as I could in the fic, but I probably could
                have done better.<span class="popuptext" id="valk036">Code: reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. So, my next question is about the actual
            moments when Brienne is doing Jaime's makeup because it is such an intimate scene. Can
            you talk a little bit more through this intimacy and why it was important for you to
            take your time and what you really wanted to capture in this moment?</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk037')">I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
                reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
                very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
                and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit.<span class="popuptext" id="valk037">Code: canon-compliment, canon-compliant</span></span></span> How there was all of this,
            he like completely lambasted her with all of these emotions and finishes off with, "My
            name is Jaime," because he wants to be a person now and not this iconic king slayer and
            what not. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk038')">I wanted something similar, but would still
                make me feel like that, but wanted to make it more intimate and feel like it was
                still just as opening, but with actions and not just with words.<span class="popuptext" id="valk038">Code: canon-compliant</span></span></span> So, this was
            sort of like, again, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk039')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk088')">trying to work through gender things. I
                    wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
                    their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
                    that would fit them better or explore better.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk088">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> I wanted to also

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. My final question about the specifics of
            the fic are when Brienne walks in on Jaime for the first time, she sees him putting on
            makeup, so sort of like the flash backs. Can you talk a little bit about this moment
            when Brienne first finds him doing his makeup?</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> I was kind of questioning how to handle when I
            first kind of <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:30:20]</span> to it. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk040')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk089')">I
                    guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted

                <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk090')">I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
                    of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
                    having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
                    leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
                    little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk090">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="valk040">Code: important-quote, genre-other</span></span></span>
            through it because I felt in that moment, Brienne being someone who also has lived on
            the cusp of her gender roles for most of her life, would be more of a sympathetic ear.
            And I think even though Jaime might know that and recognize it, he still doesn't know
            how she would react. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk041')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk091')">I wanted to kind of write it as like a self-fulfilling

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. My final question about your fic

            is never write an entire fan fic in Starbucks.<span class="popuptext" id="valk042">Code: drafting</span></span></span> But also, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk043')">I learned how much writing a one shot sounds good and all in

            as a one shot because unfortunately, I lost the file in a crash for the back story and
            what not that I had written. I kind of felt so despondent that I never touched it again
            after that. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk044')">It was
                definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk092')">knowing that I could go back and explore myself with fan

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. I'm so sorry you lost your
            files.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Yeah, my brother tried to fix my computer and he
            turned my computer on my bed without a static fan, so it had a little tiny shock hit my
            computer and took out my C and D drive, on top of my power supply.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Oh my gosh. That's so awful. I'm so
            sorry.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> He thankfully replaced both of them, but I lost all
            my files, like even my backup was gone.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> That's awful. Man. For the next part, I want to
            ask you about just some trends in the fan community and sort of get your thoughts on it.
            There are a few visualizations that I have at the bottom of the document. The first
            visualization is the most popular ships across the seasons, so you can see the different
            ships on the left and then the different colors over when each ship was used around when
            it was published, right, so season one and two is like when fics that are published
            around seasons one and two. So, Jaime and Brienne are one of the top ones and you talked
            a little bit about Jaime and Brienne's hetero normative perspective of their
            relationship. But there's a few others that I think are interesting that are on there.
            You got Peytr Baelish and Sansa Stark, Sansa and Marjory, Rinley and Lauris, John and
            Sansa, etc. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit through some of these
            ships.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> So the interesting one and I actually looked at
            that, at the beginning of season one and season two more Jaime and Brienne ships than
            any other, which I think is more of a testament to like those were the book fans writing
            it and that was what had existed on AO3 prior to the show coming out, which was
            interesting. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk045')">And then it just kind of gets more
                depressing as it goes on. For some reason, John and Sansa's the most popular ship.
                It's like, I understand that they're not technically related, but I don't get it
                because in the book, they had this very tense relationship and in the show I know
                that they were more around each other.<span class="popuptext" id="valk045">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span> But, I don't see it. I don't see it.
            John and Daenerys obviously is the expected because everyone knows the R plus L equals
            to J theory and all that. Aria/Gendry probably another good one that I like. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk046')">Peytr/Sansa, I want to have some words with people.<span class="popuptext" id="valk046">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span>
            Cersei/Jaime, as depressing as it is, they were probably the healthiest relationship
            with each other for most of their lives, which is depressing because they're twins. At
            the same time, that was the only positive reinforcement they had and that says a lot.

            Missandei and Daenerys is...</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I think that's a friendship too because it's
            got the ampersand instead of the slash.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Oh, that's true, yeah. If you want to be, it's a
            queer friendship between Jaime and Brienne, it still doesn't count. I love them, but it
            doesn't count.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, I think it would really depend on your
            readings and making that explicit between Jaime and Brienne too, like you do. They're
            not necessarily romantic in your fic, but you're making it explicit that they're sort of
            not sis or hetero.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Yeah, exactly. It's very difficult to find again.
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk052')">It was just a lot of Nora Roberts style in AO3 for

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> There is a lot of incest. I think that was the
            thing that I shouldn't have been surprised about, but I was. You know. In some of the
            top additional tags, like incest pops up quite often across the different seasons and I
            was like, "Oh, yeah, that makes sense."</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Yeah, of course. Why am I surprised? I think it's
            more the volume is surprising, not the fact it's there, it's the fact that, oh, there's
            a lot of it.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, it's true. Next visualization, so what I
            did was, I went through all the fics, so there's a total of almost 30,000 fics and I
            went through to find how many fics used some kind of additional tags that signaled,
            thinking about LGBTQ plus issues and identities, so I searched for words like bi,
            heteronormativity, trans, dysphoria, non-binary, LGBTQ, etc, etc. I have like the whole
            list there. It's a very small number.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk053')">Yeah, it's depressingly small. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk100')">I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot

            picture where it's like you open and I'm disappointed. I don't know what I was expecting
            kind of thing.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> I'm not surprised, but again, sigh. I was expecting
            it would be 5,000. Apparently, it's not even that.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> No, it's very small and I might have to change.
            I might add some of the searches or something like that to see if I can develop it a
            little bit more. As of this moment, it's a very tiny percentage.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk057')">I would almost want to just write fic out of
            spite.<span class="popuptext" id="valk057">Code: fan-politics, critical-uptake</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Like, "I'm coming in. I'm changing these
            stats." What was your opinion, I mean this is sort of like that part of the interview,
            but I'm just going to ask you. What was your opinion on the end of season eight with
            Brienne sort of writing Jaime's story in the book?</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk058')">I think that bit of the
                ending, was actually the one I had the least amount of problems with, out of all of
                it because its part of the King's guard. This was like an ideal kind of took Jaime's
                spot in like the head.<span class="popuptext" id="valk058">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span> I saw that moment not as part of their relationship in
            any way. It was like she was just doing a duty. She was supposed to do that kind of look
            and in that way, I think she had kind of hardened herself again. "This is just something
            I have to do," but it's also honoring him, so I think at that point she had grieved and
            that she was starting to move on. That was kind of like a closure. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk059')">I mean, personally, I think the whole bit where he leaves and comes
                back is bullshit. Like, I'm sorry, I can't even mince words with that<span class="popuptext" id="valk059">Code: canon-critique</span></span></span>. I've
            read people's reasons for it about how Jaime was not at a point in his realization arc
            when he went back to King's Landing in the show that realized, "Oh, right, my sister is
            manipulating me and we are doing some gross things right beside my son's dead body."
            That is wonderful. It was just like he never got that kind of arc, his full redemption
            arc. They went half way and then they're like, "Okay, I'm going back to Cersei, bye."
            And I'm like, why would you spend a month sleeping with someone after having this
            humongous build up to their relationship and then in one day, it's like, okay, bye. One
            episode. Okay, cool, they had sex, excellent. Now we're taking Jaime back to the plot,
            so we can kill him later on. I would have wanted Jaime to go back and as he walked in
            front of the falls, he just like guts Cersei to kill her first.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, that's what I thought was going to
            happen.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Yeah, the fallon card cannot be locked full. The
            entire thing was like a gold hand wrapped around your throat. That's literally like
            Jaime's way to go back and kill Cersei himself with his prosthetic. That was the point.
            That would have been so cool. I would have liked to see that part happen where he's
            like, it's a mercy killing before the rocks fall and before she dies. He wants to be the
            one to kill her first because he feels responsible for everything that's happened. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk060')">That would have been a good way to end it, not, we're going to hug
                each other and we're going to let some rocks fall.<span class="popuptext" id="valk060">Code: canon-critique</span></span></span> I'm just reliving the
            anger I had last year. It's great. Wonderful. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk061')">I had some really bad, some
                really heated discussions with a friend on my dashboard on Twitter. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'valk104')">We just did that, like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
                    and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
                    interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
                    dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
                    front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
                    interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
                    not try and put this away.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="valk104">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> Yeah, it was a whole mess. People
                came out in droves, angry for different reasons.<span class="popuptext" id="valk061">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, that whole season was a
            disaster.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Yeah, it was a train crash. I canceled my
            subscription to HBO several seasons prior, so I was just like on my Twitter dashboard
            going, "Okay, guys, spoil me. I don't care anymore. I'm at a point where I'm above all
            of this. Give me spoilers, so I can be mad at them from a distance." Then be like, that
            is not part of my life anymore.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, not dedicating hours upon hours to
            this.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Yeah, I don't have enough energy to be angry like
            that anymore and care about a show like that anymore. It's wonderful if you can, but I
            can't take it personally like that. I have <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:47:18]</span>
            and go to work and to have energy for that later on too. I can't do that.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. No, it's definitely, sometimes feels like
            a full-time job.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Yeah, that is a third one, right? That was part of
            the graphing as well, your little chart for common additional tags. Okay.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, it's just basic most common additional
            tags, which I think is probably most common additional tags throughout all
            fandoms.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Yeah, okay. So, was this organized? Like the
            numbers, is that an accumulation over time? No, okay, sorry. Based on how much was put
            out per season.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yep, exactly. Yeah, so seasons one and two,
            most popular one was no English, which is also very interesting.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> And Somalia. That's an interesting subset I didn't
            know.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, no, I was like, "Oh, that's cool." Again,
            another fun surprise.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Yeah, if there's like a full Somalian side
            abandoned area on the internet that was like reading and watching along. That's kind of
            interesting.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. Awesome. All right, so I'm going to stop
            the recording.</p>
        <p><strong>valk:</strong> Okay.</p>
