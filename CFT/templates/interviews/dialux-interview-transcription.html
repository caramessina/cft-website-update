    <h1>Interview of Dialux by Cara Marta Messina</h1><h2>Conducted on 2020-02-07</h2><br/>

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So, today on February 7, 2020 I am interviewing
            Dialux. Do you mind just saying..</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. I am Dialux, and I consent to being
            interviewed by Cara Messina.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Thank you. Okay. So, we'll start with just some
            basic questions about yourself. So, first can you tell me a little about yourself as a
            fanfiction writer? When and how did you start writing fanfiction, what fandoms did you
            start with, and how did your participation in fan communities change over the
            years?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Okay. So, I think I started writing fan fiction
            when I was very young. I think the Harry Potter books came out when I was in third
            grade, that was when I started reading them. And I think that was my first real
            fanfiction, because we had some essays to write in class. One of the things that I wrote
            was on Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall, which is very deeply embarrassing to
            talk about. You know, however many years later. But I honestly didn't know what
            fanfiction was then. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia001')">But a few years later when I was, I think,
                13, my friend introduced me to like crack Lord Of The Rings fiction.<span class="popuptext" id="dia001">Code: genre-other</span></span></span> And that
            kind of was the entry to multiple fandoms, in which, I was basically like, "Oh, my god.
            There's so much to read out here that we have access to. That you don't need to go to
            libraries for, that you don't need somebody else to monitoring you for." So, that was
            basically how I started getting into fanfiction. But writing it on a more in-depth level
            was probably when I was a little bit older. And I started writing Harry Potter fan
            fiction. I think there was... God. Lord Of The Rings fanfiction around the time. I was
            jumping through fandoms for a very long time. I mean, I think that's what you have to do
            as any person in fandom. So, yeah. I think I started out on LJ, Live Journal. And from
            there kind of migrated to fanfiction.net, and then from there to AO3, Archive of Our
            Own. Depending on the era of the time, and where the most popular platform was. So, I
            think my participation in fan communities changed. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia002')">I had a very close group of friends on Live Journal back
                in the early 2000s. That, I think, probably because I was a teenager. Perhaps this
                is because of all those reasons. But that kind of close-knittedness has never kind
                of shown up for me ever since. I think I tend to participate now on more, "Oh, this
                is really interesting for me. And this is really fascinating." And I'll go into it
                for the material as opposed to the friendships themselves.<span class="popuptext" id="dia002">Code: fan-politics, audience</span></span></span> I do participate
            in quite a few exchanges, I have noticed. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia003')">Mostly to keep
                myself writing. Because, otherwise, I would just not publish those materials until
                it becomes, you know. It's basically sitting on my hard drive for years and years on
                end, and finally I get the opportunity and the motivation to publish them.<span class="popuptext" id="dia003">Code: drafting</span></span></span>
            Because there's a deadline coming up, and I have to do something. So, yeah. I believe
            that's how my participation has changed. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia004')">Because,
                initially, it was definitely a very close-knit, just writing for friends and with
                friends.<span class="popuptext" id="dia004">Code: audience</span></span></span> And then over the years we kind of just drifted apart, we all fell
            apart into different fandoms, kind of lost touch. And then I also have been relatively
            keeping to myself, let me put it that way.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great, thank you. So, what fandoms do you
            currently participate in, and why?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> I think right now the biggest one that I'm
            currently interested in is probably The Witcher, over the past couple of weeks. Simply
            because it was very fascinating. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia005')">But I've also recently published work in Fleabag, which
                was one of the fandoms that I had to write for for my Yuletide assignment.<span class="popuptext" id="dia005">Code: fan-practices-uptake, motivation</span></span></span>
            That's, actually, I think how I have been jumping from fandom to fandom. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia006')">There's a couple of things that you see that are kind of
                interesting, and then you kind of identify a certain actor, or a certain character
                that you kind of find interesting. And then jump from there to another.<span class="popuptext" id="dia006">Code: motivation</span></span></span> I
            mean, for me that was... I've also seen Sex Education over the past couple of weeks. And
            some of the character dynamics there were very fascinating. Yeah. I think right now, the
            fandom I'm mostly participating in is probably Good Omens and The Witcher. Those are the
            two that I'm mostly in right now.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. So, can you tell me a little
            bit about any text you've produced recently?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia007')">Yes. I think my most recent published fan fiction is a
                Percy Weasley, second person point of view, post canon. In which he is attempting to
                basically restructure his society by running on a platform of big structural change.
                Which might sound vaguely familiar. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia091')"> But it was, I
                    think, mostly due to the kind of deep rage that I was feeling over the entire
                    Democratic Primaries over the past couple of months. And almost the past year.
                    In which everything felt very much like a lot of talk, and not a lot of doing.
                    And at some point, you need some catharsis. And kind of putting it out into
                    fiction and seeing something changing. Or, not even seeing something changing.
                    But seeing people trying to effect change, and willing to fight for that change
                    felt very important to me. And basically that entire fanfic is kind of born out
                    of that seething, massive, "I want to see something happening."<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia091">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span>
                And I will see it happen in fiction, if not in reality.<span class="popuptext" id="dia007">Code: important-quote, motivation</span></span></span> But, yeah. The other
            ones are basically a couple of... My Yuletide assignment, which was the Fleabag one.
            Which is inspired by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, in which she kind of talks about how if she
            ever did a season three of Fleabag, she would be going back to it only when she was a
            lot older. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia008')">was talking about that, and I felt like
                that was a really fascinating look into that psyche. And seeing how Fleabag and the
                Priest would meet up. And how they would be after having separated for 20, 30 years,
                coming back to see each other after they have had full lives apart, but somehow
                still wanting something more. Which, I think, it's definitely, kind of, for me, I am
                not old enough to be discussing 50 year old, 60 year old life plans. But my life
                path has never been very straight, or what I felt that it would be. Because when I
                was, what? 15, I probably thought I'd be an engineer. And then after that I thought
                I'd be a doctor. And then, suddenly, now I'm a lawyer. And I thought I'd be in the
                U.S., and I'm in India. And it's a very wildly divergent and strange life path for
                me. And that's only been over, what? 10 years, 10, 15 years. And I can't even
                imagine how that would be over 20, 30 years. And identifying that desire for home,
                and wanting people to be that. As opposed to a given area, or a given job, or
                anything like that, felt very poignant to me at that particular point in
                time.<span class="popuptext" id="dia008">Code: motivation</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia009')">So, that was one fic that I was relatively and very
                proud of. To be honest.<span class="popuptext" id="dia009">Code: reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you so much. So, I'm going to ask
            you some questions. Well, lots of questions, about your Game of Thrones fanfiction,
            which I really enjoyed reading. It was so beautifully written.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Oh, thank you so much.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. It was lovely. I was
            enthralled.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. Probably too sweet about it. Yeah,
            good.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So, I guess we'll start with sort of general
            questions. But can you describe your motivation behind writing this
            fanfiction?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia010')">So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
                the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
                Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
                film."<span class="popuptext" id="dia010">Code: fan-practices-uptake, motivation</span></span></span> And I was very interested in this entire... I was in that fandom, and
            I had a lot of friends in that fandom, and I definitely enjoyed the pairing. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia011')">So, the
                person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
                universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.<span class="popuptext" id="dia011">Code: fan-practices-uptake, genre-other, audience</span></span></span> And
            suddenly I realized that a lot of my historical alternate universes were book oriented,
            and not movie oriented. I did not have a very big basis of movies to call on. I think
            the only one that I had was Braveheart, and that was not something that I wanted to
            really discuss. That doesn't really have a happy ending, so I didn't really want to
            focus on that. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia012')">So then I realized that Jodhaa Akbar, which is
                definitely a Desi film, had a wonderful set of characters that was definitely
                angsty, but had a wonderfully happy ending. And allowed me to write about something
                that was kind of dear to my heart as well. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia092')">Because it was a Desi film. It was one
                    representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
                    those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
                    to bridge them.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia092">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span> Because you have to. Because it's not just
                about love, or it's not just about anything. It's about your pride, it's about your
                family's livelihood. All of those kind of come together, you have to do it. You
                don't want to, but, somehow, you have to. I think it's that gritting of your teeth,
                and getting on with life that kind of really draws me in.<span class="popuptext" id="dia012">Code: canon-relation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So, I would love to hear about some general
            choices you made in your fic. So, how come you chose to make Westeros Desi?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia013')">I chose to make it Desi because I am Desi. and I wanted
                to experience it.<span class="popuptext" id="dia013">Code: important-quote, identity-bending</span></span></span> I mean, when you look at Jodaa Akbar's movie. I did kind of
            think about removing it from its roots as a Rajput and a Mughal, and a very crazy film.
            In which you have all of that. But I really did feel like there was something being
            taken away when you tried to remove those tensions, and that anger, and that visceral,
            almost betrayal, and that hatred. Because it's only when you have that... Because it's
            very difficult to identify, or to state that hatred. Let me put it that way. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia014')">And if you're just starting from scratch, then it's
                difficult to create why two people would hate each other so much. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia093')">I mean, you need to have that religious, and
                    cultural, and those barriers in order for that to
                happen.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia093">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="dia014">Code: reflection</span></span></span> And I think, at least, when you're looking at those
            two characters, especially Jon and Sansa, those are not two characters that would hate
            each other, in and of themselves. But, rather, they need some external forces to push
            them two beside each other. And, of course, in both the original movie, Jodhaa Akbar,
            and in the canon, they slowly grow. The canon of A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of
            Thrones. They both slowly grow to understand and love each other, despite all of their
            differences in class, and upbringing, in religion. Whatever. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia015')">So, I mean, I think the
                choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
                setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
                trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
                for it.<span class="popuptext" id="dia015">Code: identity-bending, motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Okay, awesome. So, I guess you sort of already
            talked about why you paired Jodhaa Akbar with the Game Of Thrones characters in John and
            Sansa.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yes.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> And the motivation, so I won't ask that
            question. But can you talk a little bit about why you chose to use second person point
            of view?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Oh. That's a really funny answer to be honest.
            Because I was flying back from the U.S. at the time. And when I'm flying I tend to kind
            of take my laptop and do a lot of work on the plane, because I cannot sleep on planes.
            But at that particular time, I had fallen sick with a really bad cold. And as a result,
            I had downloaded a lot of fanfiction. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia016')">And it was football RPF
                (real person fic) fanfiction. Which was very interesting, because I think it was
                just after the 2018 World Cup.<span class="popuptext" id="dia016">Code: genre-other</span></span></span> And I had been living with a couple people.
            They were very interested in it, and suddenly I got hooked. It was just a very wild
            summer for a couple of months. And when I was coming back I had so much football RPF
            fanfiction on my phone that I was reading. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia017')">And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
                view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
                you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point of
                view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
                what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
                more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.<span class="popuptext" id="dia017">Code: important-quote, fan-practices-uptake, genre-other, motivation</span></span></span> And the
            thing is, I don't usually like writing in second person. Or, I didn't before writing
            this fanfic. And it was kind of a revelatory experience, to be honest, seeing it and
            experiencing variety. Because it felt much more visceral to me. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia018')">And that also came across to a lot of readers, is what
                they were telling me, at least. Because they felt like there was a lot more gravitas
                to the entire fic that you wouldn't see in a lot of my other
            fanfics.<span class="popuptext" id="dia018">Code: reception</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Yeah, I definitely felt that, too. I
            feel like I haven't actually read a second person fic in years. I was like, "Oh, my
            gosh." I forgot.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia019')">Yeah. I mean, I really do
                feel like there aren't that many second person point of views that kind of allow you
                to immerse yourself into that person, or into that character.<span class="popuptext" id="dia019">Code: genre-other</span></span></span> And it's really
            kind of... Because, actually, I personally don't like Jon's character very
            much.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Oh, scandalous.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. I mean, it's not that I don't like his
            character. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia020')">I mean that I just don't think I relate to him at the
                same extent that I relate to Sansa.<span class="popuptext" id="dia020">Code: canon-relation</span></span></span> And it just, to me, every time that I
            write in his character I always feel slightly awkward. And then when I was writing in
            his character in this fanfic, I felt like I understood him a lot better than I had ever
            kind of understood him before or after, in any of the other fanfics that I've ever
            done.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Okay. So, my next question is can you talk a
            little about some of the research that you did? So, I think it was in the supplemental
            materials that you mentioned that you did a lot of research. So, can you talk a little
            about the research you did and why it was important?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia021')">I think that for
                the actual research it was not so much that I did it for this particular fanfic, as
                it was more that I love that era a lot. So, I had tended to research it before, as
                well. So, I had a lot of information that I kind of knew in colloquial terms.<span class="popuptext" id="dia021">Code: research</span></span></span>
            And then when I was doing it, I wanted to make sure that I was talking about, I don't
            know, something like Akbar's father, Humayun, suddenly falling and tripping down stairs,
            and dying because his hits the stone. And I vaguely remembered that it was a truly
            ridiculous way to die when you're a warlord. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia022')">But I did
                not remember the exact way that he had died, so then I kind of went searching for
                that. And then, I mean, from there it kind of spiraled into researching other things
                and kind of reading up more about Akbar and more about Jodhaa. And I'm an avid
                research. I mean, that's what I do now.<span class="popuptext" id="dia022">Code: research</span></span></span> I love reading up on pretty much
            anything. I mean, I've said it so many times, but history is if I hadn't been worried
            about my future. Because, for me, having a very stable future is very important and from
            a very young age. So, that's why I went into engineering and everything. But if that
            hadn't been an issue, then I would have definitely jumped into history without a second
            thought. So, I mean, identifying all of that, to me is just more like I had a generic
            understanding of a lot of this stuff. But then further research into a lot of it kind of
            gave me more information. And sometimes some things just kind of worked out. Because if
            you're looking at like the colors that Sansa was wearing and Sansa refused to wear
            throughout the entire fic, it starts out where white is mourning colors in the Hindu
            culture. So, only widows tend to wear white. All white, I should say. So then she
            doesn't want to do that, but that white was also Stark colors according to Game of
            Thrones canon. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia023')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia094')">And then, of course, you have the Targaryen
                    colors, which are black, which are mourning colors according to the Western
                    culture. <span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia094">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span>And all of it kind of comes together. And, of course,
                Rajput culture is known for its red, its vibrant, blood red. And obviously, that's a
                Targaryen color.<span class="popuptext" id="dia023">Code: canon-compliant</span></span></span> And Sansa has to balance the fact that it's both something
            that she likes on her own, and something that she doesn't want to give to Jon. And at
            the same time it's like, she needs to say, "Well, it's mine. Not just yours." <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia024')">And all of this kind of, to me, I mean, I think that's what
                a lot of fanficiton is, at least. It's taking things that are already there and kind
                of pooling them together. And sometimes you have amazing coincidences that people
                just don't think about. And it's about exploiting those coincidences, and making
                them sound like, "Oh, I'm so brilliant. I actually had thought about it
                beforehand."<span class="popuptext" id="dia024">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span> But you're identifying it. But there were a couple things that I
            think... Especially the names of the words I think that I had used. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia025')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia095')">Where I
                    just didn't translate them into Rajput or Hindi words. Because I just use
                    whatever I knew, because I speak Kannada at home.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia095">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span> And that's
                another language entirely. And I was just running out of time, and I said, "You know
                what? No, I'll just handle it myself. And not translate it, and hope that nobody
                minds.<span class="popuptext" id="dia025">Code: reflection</span></span></span>" But, yeah. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia026')">I think a lot of the research and a lot of the material
                was just about identifying and pulling disparate ideas together that I knew.
                    <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia096')">From either my own culture because, of course,
                    this is partially my own culture.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia096">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span> And also, the historical
                details of <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:27:49]</span>.<span class="popuptext" id="dia026">Code: important-quote, research</span></span></span> Like Jon's name, and
            what it means on a personal level, on a societal level, on a historical level. All of
            this kind of comes together for Jon in that fanfic. And how it all kind of comes
            together to mean something. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia027')">And I think that was what
                was very important to me, especially in this story, was puling it all together so
                that there weren't any open endings. And the research really, somehow, it helped in
                pulling that together.<span class="popuptext" id="dia027">Code: research</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you for the thorough answer. So,
            can you talk a little bit about some of the supplemental materials you created? I really
            enjoyed reading the fic and then going to the supplemental materials, and sort of seeing
            your breakdowns, and your explanations of your choices. So, can you talk about the
            process of creating that?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Oh. Well, first of all, congratulations for like
            reading it. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia028')">Because I honestly expected nobody to do
                that. It's good to see that people are just as interested in a lot of it, in this
                stuff. You know?<span class="popuptext" id="dia028">Code: audience</span></span></span> So, I mean, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia029')">I think that the
                thing I wanted to keep in mind was that I was doing the research, but I was also not
                putting as much research into it as I probably should have if I wanted to make it
                historical fiction.<span class="popuptext" id="dia029">Code: research</span></span></span> Because, I mean, the first Jodhaa Akbar film is not
            anything other than historical fiction. So, I really needed to keep that in mind while I
            was going through it, because there's a lot of historical fact and everything that I was
            kind of putting in, and throwing in there. But they weren't necessarily necessary or
            true, and <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia030')">I was literally
                just pulling things from here, and there. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia097')">And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well as
                    South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
                    Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia097">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="dia030">Code: authors-note, reflection</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia031')">And that was one thing I wanted to be clear about.
                Because, yes, it was research. But I think I wanted to keep to the spirit of the
                movie, as well as the spirit of the A Song of Ice and Fire canon.<span class="popuptext" id="dia031">Code: research</span></span></span> And then,
            finally, only later go onto the culture <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:30:28]</span>.
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia032')">But when I was making the
                actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
                actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
                identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
                identify.<span class="popuptext" id="dia032">Code: authors-note, drafting</span></span></span> And, I mean, especially when I was talking about the risking
            friendly fire, or something like that when I was referring to Jon's armor. And how a lot
            of those were vagaries of Mughal officer life. About getting uniforms, and all of that
            stuff. And those are just things that I had vaguely remembered were materials that were
            important. And had been discussed by Mughal generals. And that was just something that I
            kind of added whenever I felt that it was important. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia033')">But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
                and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
                that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
                ideas from.<span class="popuptext" id="dia033">Code: authors-note, reflection</span></span></span> And there are actually things that I'm pretty sure I didn't come
            up with within the story itself. I think that tree branch bending was not something that
            I had ever really thought about. But then, somehow, I'm pretty sure that I read it
            somewhere. And I honestly cannot remember where. And I've been asking people, and nobody
            has been able to tell me where I've got it from. So, I'm just like, maybe my mind is
            more imaginative than I think it is? Yeah. So, I think that's the essential thing. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia034')">Just building that list kind of helps me know where and how
                I'm getting the material, and the assumptions that I've made throughout the fanfic.
                And, therefore, helps make it easier to kind of discuss it later, I think.<span class="popuptext" id="dia034">Code: authors-note</span></span></span>
            Especially because I was really worried about it with this fanfic. To be fair. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia035')">I was really worried about how it
                would be perceived by the fandom, how it would be received by people even outside of
                the fandom.<span class="popuptext" id="dia035">Code: fan-politics, audience</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia036')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia037')">Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
                    be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia037">Systems of Power: racism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="dia036">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, identity-bending</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia038')">So, that was one of the
                primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
                sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.<span class="popuptext" id="dia038">Code: authors-note, motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. So, I'll probably ask a little bit later
            about... Actually, no, I'll do it now. So, can you talk a little bit about maybe some of
            the feedback you received? Since that was something you were thinking about. And then,
            also, talk a little about your anticipation for the feedback. So, you said you wanted to
            make sure that you, while you were race bending, not being racist or relying on racist
            tropes. So, also at the beginning of your fic you wrote, "And everyone who wants to come
            shrieking at me that Sansa's hair is red and eyes are blue." Right. So, can you talk a
            little about your anticipation of feedback on multiple levels? Both sort of learning
            about and trying to make sure you weren't being, or putting out racist ideas. But also,
            potentially worrying about backlash?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia039')">I was
                really worried about it, actually. Because I spoke to a couple people before I
                published the fanfic. Because I was kind of worried about it, and I wasn't sure how
                it would be received.<span class="popuptext" id="dia039">Code: audience</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia040')">And my friends in the fandom were all like, "Okay, well,
                we trust you. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia098')">Because it's also your
                    culture. You know what you're doing, you know where you're coming from. But we
                    would not do it." And, I mean, the vast majority of them were from the U.K. or
                    the U.S., and they were not from the same culture.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia098">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span> And they
                were like, "We would be very hesitant about it, but we trust you. If you know what
                you're doing, then go ahead and do it." But they were very supportive in that
                manner. But it wasn't a blanket support, as I was kind of hoping for, I should
                say.<span class="popuptext" id="dia040">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span> So, then I kind of went into publishing the fanfic. I was pretty
            apprehensive about it. I wasn't entirely sure how it would be. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia041')">And I wasn't sure people would
                think that it was good enough. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia099')">Because I was also combining both South Indian and North Indian tropes, to a
                    certain extent. And those weren't necessarily very compatible. And there's a lot
                    of history behind that and everything.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia099">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span> And I wasn't entirely
                sure how people would perceive it.<span class="popuptext" id="dia041">Code: fan-politics, audience</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia042')">But people were very kind about it. And I haven't
                actually gotten a single negative feedback on that fanfic to date.<span class="popuptext" id="dia042">Code: reception</span></span></span> And, I
            mean, that was another thing. Because I think during that time, this particular fanfic
            meant a lot to me. Because especially, first of all, as I mentioned before, I had a kind
            of closer understanding of Jon's character than I had ever had before. But also, Sansa,
            as a character, felt very raw to me in this particular fic. In which she was very
            much... She was so unhappy, so desperately unhappy with her lot in life. But she wanted
            to make it as good of a lot as she could. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia043')">And
                especially when she has that fight with Jon and she goes back home. And that was, I
                think, the point of catharsis. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia100')">Because especially when you're looking at a lot of Indian mothers, and Indian
                    women who get into marriages at a very young age. You have to deal with your
                    husband's family, you have to deal with that entire kind of stigma. About you
                    have to be the one to adjust and to compromise to a far greater extent than your
                    husband.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia100">Systems of Power: cultural-difference sexism</span></span></span> And all of these kind of had come together and had
                been marinating for a very long time. And I feel like Sansa, in this, was very much
                the product of that. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia101')">Where she was
                    just trying to fight it, she was such a perfect child in that culture. And then
                    suddenly she has to kind of leave her culture behind. Or, not leave her culture
                    behind, but adjust to a new culture.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia101">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span> And she feels like she's
                being punished by her old one for no fault of her own. And all of it, kind of, her
                desperate unhappiness, her tensions with her mother were a big part of the fic, I
                think, for me.<span class="popuptext" id="dia043">Code: reflection</span></span></span> Where her mother is willing to give up her own honor, and
            basically tell Sansa, "Maybe you should die. If it comes down to it, if you're so
            unhappy, maybe it's better for you to die than to live with the shame." And just
            imagining that kind of anger, and that kind of fear, and all of that kind of came
            together for me.<span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia044')"> And I was so
                worried. Because all of this was very close to my heart, and I did not want to have
                to deal with a lot of backlash, or feedback, or having to fight to say, "Well, I
                don't mean to be rude on any of these kinds of things." These are meant with respect
                and they're meant with love. And they're from a part of myself.<span class="popuptext" id="dia044">Code: fan-politics, audience</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia045')">So, with all of that in mind, the actual fandom
                response was absolutely wonderful, and absolutely, completely respectful. And none
                of my fears at all came to fruition.<span class="popuptext" id="dia045">Code: reception</span></span></span> So, I think that was one of the best
            things that I could have expected for from the fandom. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia046')">Because they were all so kind, and so respectful of the entire fic in
                general.<span class="popuptext" id="dia046">Code: reception</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. So, can you talk about what you think
            some of the strengths of this fanfiction are?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Oh. Yes. I think one of the biggest ones is
            probably the voice, I feel like. And I think how closely readers can get immersed within
            the characters. I think those are the two majors ones in the fic. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia047')">Because that's what I keep feeling whenever I look back at
                it, was how I got almost consumed by the characters when I was writing them.<span class="popuptext" id="dia047">Code: drafting</span></span></span>
            And I think that kind of comes across in some way when you're reading them as
            well.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. I definitely agree with that.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Thank you.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> What about some of the challenges?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Oh, how to end it. I did not know how to end it.
            I was so confused. Yeah, that was the biggest one. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia048')">I
                didn't feel like I could end it with, "Oh, everybody has kids and they're all
                happy." Because that felt very weird, and kind of disjointed with the rest of the
                fic.<span class="popuptext" id="dia048">Code: reflection</span></span></span> Especially because this is when they're so young within the fanfic. I
            think even when you look at some of my other fanfic, I think that's one of the biggest
            challenges that I faced, is identifying an ending that works for me when I'm writing it.
            So, I don't know if you've read it. But there's a fanfic that I've written called The
            Tempest, The Psycho, and The God Damn Hurricane. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia049')">And
                in that Sansa can see ghosts. And throughout the entire fic, it's a long fic and
                everything, but one of the biggest issues for me was, how do I end this?<span class="popuptext" id="dia049">Code: reflection</span></span></span>
            Because I could not imagine her going back to living with her parents, and living with
            her family, and all of that. So, then I had to figure out a way to end it without her
            changing drastically, and choosing something completely out of the ordinary. But there
            had to be an ending for her that fit her character at the end of that particular
            journey. So then in this particular journey it had to be, for me, I was actually
            thinking about adding another arc with Sansa. Perhaps, later, or after the battle had
            ended. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia050')">But to me, it felt like it began with Jon and
                it had to end with Jon. And it had to end with him finally being triumphant, and
                finally being happy for his triumph at the end of this fanfic.<span class="popuptext" id="dia050">Code: reflection</span></span></span> As opposed to
            in the beginning, where he keeps feeling like he's the best. But he's not entirely sure
            that he is, because he has no external validation for it. And finally, the end of it, he
            does have it in the form of Sansa, and in the form of an army, and in the form of the
            crown.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. Yeah, endings are
            hard.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Okay. So, I wanted to ask about some of the
            additional tags that you chose, too. I have a list of them on the interview questions
            sheet.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Right, I have notes.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. I was wondering if you could talk
            through some of your choices with the additional tags?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia051')">So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
                clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
                Jon is raised a Targaryen.<span class="popuptext" id="dia051">Code: canon-resistant, audience</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia052')">And it is an angsty fic. It's not like a comedy, there is angst.
                And it's one of the major points of the entire fanfic.<span class="popuptext" id="dia052">Code: angst</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia053')">And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
                because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
                other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
                fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
                particular tag.<span class="popuptext" id="dia053">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake, audience</span></span></span> But then I also wanted to make sure that it was pretty clear
            to everyone what this fic was about. Especially the, "Don't try this at home." Tag.
            This, to me, just because it's an absolute rage that both Jon and Sansa have in both of
            their families. And that's why also none of this drama is worth it. Let's be really real
            here. Because it really isn't. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia054')">I mean, this fic is obviously
                dramatized and all that. But the essential part of it is that both of them have
                <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia102')">this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
                    that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
                    see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
                    very difficult way of going through life.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia102">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span> And it's not
                necessarily a happy life that you lead when you have that kind of a
                mentality.<span class="popuptext" id="dia054">Code: angst</span></span></span> So, yeah. That was the entire point of both of those tags. But I
            also tend to write a lot more of Stark Family view. Including various such material
            across the board. And this was, I think, one of the very few fics that I have that
            talked about more Targaryen family view, mostly because of Jon being involved in that.
            And that was one of the things that was kind of... I was surprised at how much I was
            interested in that. Especially when Rhaenys kind of comes up to Jon, and she's fighting
            him for his own material. For his crown, I should say. And she wants that crown so much.
            And I think Jon says at one point, but Rhaenys is his sister. And he'll still take
            everything that he can get. Because despite the fact that she's his sister, despite the
            fact that they're family, there is something that matters to him more. And Sansa can't
            understand that, of course, within the confines of this fanfic. But I think a lot of the
            entire story is Sansa accepting that Jon's family life is not the same as her family
            life. And Jon kind of stopping himself from being so desperately angry at Sansa for
            daring to have a good family life. And both of them kind of understanding that the other
            doesn't look down on them for their respective upbringing. I can see that you asked,
            "Did anyone comment on this tag or take it up?" And the truth is, nobody's commented on
            any tags. So, yeah. That's about it.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. Awesome. Thanks. Great. Because it
            happens sometimes, so I figured it's always good to ask.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Really sweet. But, yeah. I'm not that level of...
            I think nobody really bothers to read a lot of them.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> ... A lot, in a lot of my things, so.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Okay. Awesome. So, my next question is, why did
            you decide to focus on Jon and Sansa? And we're actually going to skip that one, because
            I feel you've also answered that a lot. So, I was wondering if you could talk about some
            of the specific choices you actually made in the text?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Okay.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So, can you talk a little bit about the
            regional, and religious, and cultural tensions that play out in this?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. So, I think the regional tensions, and the
            religious tensions, and the cultural tensions, I mean, it all kind of comes together.
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia055')">I think if you look at A Song of Ice and Fire, technically,
                more than Game of Thrones, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia103')">you
                    actually get more of a cultural tension due to just the difference between the
                    North and the South. And all of that. And I do think that George R. R. Martin
                    has kind of perpetuated the idea, simply because he is English. So, the whole
                    idea that in England, where Northerners are tougher and everything than
                    Southerners. And I don't know anything more about it. But I think that's kind of
                    one of the underlying and unconscious biases within the framework of the
                    canon.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia103">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="dia055">Code: canon-critique</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia056')">But within this particular fic, as I said earlier, I
                really wanted to already have that tension. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia104')">Especially that religious tension between Jon and
                    Sansa. And have that difference, where both of them and neither of them are
                    willing to compromise on that.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia104">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="dia056">Code: canon-compliant</span></span></span> And as a result, both of
            them need to accept the other. And accept that the other is perfectly within their
            rights to worship whatever gods they want, in whatever form that they want. And
            expecting the other to compromise on that is not okay. And that's the religious tension.
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia057')">And the regional tensions, I think, are already
                there in the canon.<span class="popuptext" id="dia057">Code: canon-compliant</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia58')">But then the cultural tensions stem almost entirely
                from the differences within their upbringing, I'm pretty sure. Within their
                families. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia105')">And I mean, there are
                    cultural differences within, I mean, people that I've grown up with in India,
                    and people in the U.S. And even though you're living side by side, that doesn't
                    necessarily mean that you have the same cultural background.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia105">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span>
                And I think that's something that both of them don't understand. And both of them
                kind of try to understand slowly.<span class="popuptext" id="dia58">Code: reflection</span></span></span> And for Sansa, her religion is of such
            importance. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia059')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia106')">And, I mean, we don't know if she relies more on
                    her religion because she left her homeland, and came to the North. And just
                    wanted some desperate way, something to rely on that's her family, or that
                    reminded her of home. But to me, at least, I can imagine, especially the actual
                    Jodhaa, going to Akbar's Islamic court. And basically being all alone, and not
                    having very many allies. And finding some sort of a solace in her religion of
                    Hinduism.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia106">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="dia059">Code: canon-compliant</span></span></span> And to Akbar's credit, he did not force Jodhaa
            to convert to his own religion. And I think throughout the movie and throughout the
            fanfic, you see that the reason why there is any sort of compromise and any sort of love
            that grows between the both of them is because of that initial moment of decency between
            Jon and Sansa .Or between Jodhaa and Akbar. Where both of them, it's almost unthinking
            for Jon. Because, you know. Okay, fine. You follow whatever you want. Why is that of any
            importance? And to Sansa, that's... She doesn't understand him then. But, slowly, she
            begins to. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia060')">And if you're talking about other moments,
                like when Sansa wants to give Jon his name, and he asks her to read it out loud. I
                think that's another moment of compromise. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia107')">Because as much as she's giving him the gift,
                    she's also giving him his name. And she's stepping across her own cultural
                    boundaries to help him with that, which Jon doesn't completely
                    understand.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia107">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="dia060">Code: reflection</span></span></span> And doesn't completely appreciate until
            slowly, obviously, they grow past that. And learn past that.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. So, another moment that I
            thought was fascinating is when Jon meets and sees Sansa and Ned for the first time. And
            some of the descriptors, and the way he's focusing, really, on their physicality. And
            the ways that, obviously, he looks like Ned. So, can you talk a little bit more about
            these moments?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. I think especially when he meets Ned. Jon
            has always... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia061')">A Jon who would grow up in a Targaryen
                court would look very different in the Targaryen <span class="inaudible">[inaudible
                    00:53:09]</span> than with a Targaryen father.<span class="popuptext" id="dia061">Code: canon-resistant</span></span></span> And, obviously, it
            was his father who has played the largest role in his life, until now. So, he doesn't
            really have anyone that he looks up to, really. So, when he meets Ned for the very first
            time, he sees someone who looks very much like him. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia062')">And the thing is, as much as he looked like Ned on a physical level, Ned is not the
                Ned that we see in canon. Because he's very much a person who has been basically
                warring for however Jon has been alive.<span class="popuptext" id="dia062">Code: canon-resistant</span></span></span> So, like 20 years. And Ned has been
            at war for so long, and obviously that's taken a toll on him. And now there's suddenly
            this idea, and this hope of peace that has suddenly come up. So, there's on the verge of
            an echo between him and Ned, between Jon and Ned. And some sort of an understanding that
            is reached even before they speak. But at the same time, I don't think Jon has ever
            experienced peace. Because he has obviously been raised in a war, for a war, by a war,
            almost. And Jon does not and cannot comprehend why Ned wants peace so badly. On an
            intellectual level. He doesn't know why anyone would want to fight for peace so much.
            But at the same time, he's also almost, within him, within his mother's part of him, or
            whatever. Within that part of himself, he does understand. Because he wants peace as
            well, he doesn't want to necessarily be at war constantly. So, there's an understanding
            and still a distance, and still a confusion, and still some sort of a, "This is a part
            of me." I think. Between Jon and Ned. And regarding Jon meeting Sansa, that was just a
            completely... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia063')">Especially the quote that you put up here,
                which refers to Sansa's eyes. Because that was a moment for me, I think, more than
                anything else.<span class="popuptext" id="dia063">Code: audience</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia064')">Because, actually, Aishwarya Rai, who plays Jodhaa,
                does not have brown eyes. She has hazel eyes.<span class="popuptext" id="dia064">Code: canon-resistant</span></span></span> So, for me it was just a moment
            of, I think I just wanted to put that there. And I did not want it to be about exotic
            purple, or a lilac, or even other colors that are not my brown my color. I suppose. So,
            then I was just like, "It's not about the specialty of the color, so much as the
            specialty of the beauty." Which also somehow gives Jon that understanding, and the
            commonness between him and Sansa. Because it's not his father's exotic lilac eyes, it's
            just brown, his brown.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. And I think I have one more
            specific question about the fic. I do want to check in, though, because it's been about
            an hour. Are you okay continuing to go on?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. No issues. I have the time.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Okay. Great. Just wanted to make sure. So, you
            talked a bit about it already, but can you talk a little bit about Sansa's struggle with
            the marriage? Especially the idea that she was this perfect daughter, and then she's
            sort of thrown to the dragons?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia065')">I think
                that was something that even when you agree to a marriage, and even when you kind of
                accept that. Especially when you go into your husband's house, and if you're living
                with his parents and everything. It's a very difficult concept. And it's a very
                difficult idea.<span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia108')"> And adjusting to that
                    is a huge, almost, culture shock to people.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia108">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span>
            <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia109')">To any women, adjusting to that is
                    difficult.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia109">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span> No matter who it is, no matter where you're going.
                So, then, I mean, especially for Sansa, who needs to leave behind her entire family.
                And doesn't even know when she'll be able to go back. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia110')">And has to go to a foreign country without any
                    support, and any of her own traditions. She's the one that's upheld every single
                    tradition she has ever done. And especially when you're looking at the Hindu
                    culture, it's very difficult to uphold them.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia110">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="dia065">Code: reflection</span></span></span> Especially
            if you don't have the support. Because sometimes you have to wake up very early in the
            morning. You have to do a lot of... You know, there's a lot of rituals, there's a lot of
            material. And doing all of that on your own, and remembering every single thing that you
            have to do. And getting those materials, ensuring that they're done, and ensuring that
            they're done in the manner that they're supposed to be done, is not easy for anyone. And
            then doing it all on your own, especially in a land where nobody believes that you
            should be doing that in the first place is going to take even more of a toll than
            anything else. So, I think she first struggles with the idea of the marriage, because
            it's just the very idea of her going to the Targaryen is so abhorrent to her. And then
            she struggles more with the reality of the marriage, which is the actual practical
            difficulties of everything. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia066')">And then, finally, she
                slowly starts to grow into that. She starts to give moments of peace. You know,
                she's kind of giving Jon gifts, and she's trying to bridge that gap. Because she
                also realizes that it's her life, too. Which, I think, is one of the biggest
                realizations that a lot of women have. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia111')">Which is, "Yes, I'm miserable. I want you to be miserable. But how am I going
                    to be miserable for?" You need to let some things go, you need to move on past
                    the injustices... I need to move past the injustices that I have
                    faced.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia111">Systems of Power: sexism feminism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="dia066">Code: reflection</span></span></span> And kind of move on. Because I don't want my life
            to be just this. But, actually, it's kind of funny. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia067')">The one quote that you picked out here, "You stand before your father, bedecked in
                gossamer and lace and silk, glass thick and shining in your hair." Because that was
                one that I actually remember. Because I initially put the word jewel, and jewels in
                the place of the word glass. But then I wanted it, for her, to feel that it was
                cheaper than the jewel. Even if she had them, they didn't matter to her. Because it
                was just glass.<span class="popuptext" id="dia067">Code: reflection</span></span></span> And, obviously, in <span class="inaudible">[inaudible
                01:00:41]</span> glass would probably be pretty expensive. But from a modern
            outlook, obviously the glass would be considered far cheaper and far less interesting,
            almost. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia068')">As if, her family... <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia112')">Or, she's feeling as if her family is not willing to give

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Awesome. And then my final question
            about the fic, specifically, is what did you learn from writing this fic?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia069')">Oh. I think I learned that people are far more
                understanding than I was giving them credit for, especially because I was so afraid
                about the reception.<span class="popuptext" id="dia069">Code: fan-politics, audience</span></span></span> And then I didn't really have anything to worry about.
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia070')">But then, I also think that one of the major
                things that I learned was probably that some of the anger, it doesn't have to be a
                very you anger to be a very deep one. For it to seep into your writing. Because a
                lot of the time, especially when I'm writing angry stories and everything, they tend
                to be immediate. Like, "Okay, I'm very angry right now. And I want to have a fit.
                And I want to do it." But this was something that it had kind have been, I think,
                brewing for a very long time. And then suddenly the anger, and the angst, and the
                hurt, and the pain, all kind of came out. But at the same time, it was not just
                that. It was also about passing through that anger, and knowing that there is going
                to be someone at the end of it who's willing to accept you.<span class="popuptext" id="dia070">Code: reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. All right. So, my last sort
            of string of questions is just, I've been doing, which is part of the way I found your
            fic, I've been doing a lot of, sort of, data analysis on the metadata fic. So, like
            additional tags, and the characters that are chosen, and the ships, and all that. And I
            was wondering if you would mind taking a few minutes to sort of look through the
            visualization, as well as some of the most common ships and tags? And talk about, in
            regards to what you know about the Game Of Thrones fanfic community on AO3, what's well
            represented in these results, and what might be missing from the results?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Okay. So, I actually took a look at them this
            morning. And then I got really busy after <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 01:03:46]</span>,
            so I haven't been able to really comprehensively look at them. So, I think instead of
            looking at the character tag graph, I think I'll look at the bottom ones
            first.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Sure, yeah. Please.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. So, I think some of the things that were
            kind of interesting to me was how the number of fanfic peaked, I think, in Season Seven.
            And then it was like it fell off a cliff, almost, for a couple of ships, and also tags.
            And just in general, I think it peaked in Season Seven, and then it fell off. Which was
            surprising to me in the number of fanfics that experienced that fall. But I think it was
            not surprising to me in the fact that it happened, because I do remember a lot of people
            discussing how... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia071')">I mean, obviously, Season Eight was terrible.
                That was a given. And the ending did not do anyone any favors.<span class="popuptext" id="dia071">Code: canon-critique</span></span></span> But I think
            one of the biggest issues that I had was that, especially the Jon x Sansa fandom within.
            I came into it at the tail end of Season Five, and at the beginning of Season Six. And I
            think I was lurking for a couple of months, and then I finally published my first fanfic
            a couple of months after Season Six ended. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia072')">So, I could
                see how much the fandom had increased in size by the time Season Seven had came
                around. Because it was huge. There were a lot of people there, it had increased
                exponentially. And Season Eight made the fandom even bigger, honestly, in a certain
                way. But I also remember that there were a lot of fandom issues going on at the
                time, between people within the fandom and everything.<span class="popuptext" id="dia072">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span> And I'm not surprised
            that the number of fics fell from about 2,200 to like 700 within the space of, what?
            Like two years. Because it was, yeah. I mean, first of all, Season Eight did not do
            anyone any favors. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia073')">But, second of all, the fandom itself,
                I think, had grown to such a point that it kind of imploded. I do remember that a
                lot of good authors, and a lot of people did leave the fandom at the time.
            <span class="popuptext" id="dia073">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span>And I was included in that, especially after... I don't think I watched more than
            like three episodes of Season Eight, and I still don't know any... Like, I know the
            general gist of the ending. But I haven't actually sat and watched the actual end of
            Season Eight. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia074')">Because, first of all, the fandom was
                terrible.<span class="popuptext" id="dia074">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia075')">And second of all, the actual TV show was not doing itself any
                favors. <span class="popuptext" id="dia075">Code: canon-critique</span></span></span>Regarding the most common additional tag, I am surprised that there
            was no English tag. It seems to be the most common in Season One to Two. You know, what
            does that mean?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I haven't looked into as much. But I'm assuming
            that there were no English, and then also there's Somali. So, I think that there were a
            lot of fics that were not written in English. I'm not really sure why.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> That's very interesting.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. Because I just saw those tags, and I was
            like, "Oh."</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> You're like, "Oh." Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia076')">And then
                the fact that the alternate universe for a modern setting is so
                    <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 01:07:54]</span>. Which, to me, is very interesting.
                Because I tend to go out of my way to avoid modern alternate universes, because I
                personally don't like them.<span class="popuptext" id="dia076">Code: modern-setting</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> And it was kind of shocking to me see the number
            that are here. Because it's very startling. And I also love how smut only came in at
            Season Seven.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I know.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 01:08:22]</span>. I
            was not expecting that. Especially when you think about the source material, you'd
            expect it to be like the top one.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Mm-hmm. Yeah, no, I was surprised about that,
            too. And that fluff was so popular. I'm like, "Oh, interesting."</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia077')">You can tell
                exactly what the fandom is focused on here.<span class="popuptext" id="dia077">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia078')">And I was actually
            looking at the most common gender pairings. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia113')">It's very interesting to me, because I think if you look at any other major
                    fandom, you would probably get male male slash at a much higher rate than you're
                    getting here.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia113">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span>
            <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia114')">And it's just very interesting to me to
                    see how female male has been so prevalent across all seasons. And to such an
                    extent. And, I mean, obviously, there are a lot of theories about why that
                    is<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia114">Systems of Power: heteronormativity</span></span></span>, and how that comes about, and all of that. But I think...
                Oh, wow. Wait. Hang on. I'm looking... There's Gen that's higher than male slash in
                Season Eight.<span class="popuptext" id="dia078">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Wow. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I think that must have
            been a very fluffy couple of 845 fics. Wow, okay. I'm still kind of in a state of shock.
            Yeah. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia079')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia115')">I think
                    I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
                    make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
                    heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
                    fandoms.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia115">Systems of Power: heteronormativity</span></span></span> And I think that's probably because we don't have one
                main character and one side character that's like the sidekick to the main
                character, both of them being male. You don't have that here.<span class="popuptext" id="dia079">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, implicit-explicit</span></span></span> Apart from
            probably Jon and Sam Tarly. And even then, they don't have huge screen time. Like,
            everybody gets a chunk of screen time. But I think probably because of that, we're
            limited. But, yeah. I don't have anything to say about it, I'm still relatively
            surprised.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> No. That's totally fine. I think for a few
            people, some people had a lot to say and some people didn't. They were kind of just
            like, "Oh, that's cool."</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. And I mean, obviously, when you're looking
            at the actual ships and everything. Oh, I wanted to ask you, why exactly did you club
            Seasons One and Two together, and Seasons Three, Four, and then Five and Six?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So, part of it was because I didn't want to
            have eight corpora to work with. So, it was pure laziness for now. But I think I'm going
            to break it down season by season in the future.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Okay.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> But right now, it's sort of, kind of laziness.
            So, I have no real good reason.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Okay, okay. Yeah. I mean, actually could be very
            interesting to see how, especially between Seasons Five, Six, Seven, and Eight, how the
            Jon Snow and Sansa fandom kind of took off. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia080')">Because
                I know that a lot of people had mentioned that it was at the beginning of Season
                Six. Like, when a couple of trailers came out regarding Sansa meeting up with
                somebody in the North. It was kind of staging with Ramsay Bolton. That Jon Snow and
                Sansa Stark fandom kind of really took off. And it was the beginning of Season Six
                that it really, properly emerged. So, it would be interesting to see if there is a
                cookie cutter point that you can identify like, this is where the general public
                kind of suddenly said, "Oh, this is the moment."<span class="popuptext" id="dia080">Code: implicit-explicit</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> What I'll probably do is, I did this with...
            So, I'm also using the Legend of Korra fandom. So, what I did was I paired at everything
            by month, instead of season. And I looked at specific trends that happened, and tried to
            sort of correlate that with things in the canon text that occurred. And how people are
            picking that up and such. So, I'll probably do the same thing.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. That's really interesting. God, yeah.
            Legend of Korra was... Wow. I'm surprised that I don't really remember a lot of the
            canon. I remember consuming it, and then, suddenly, it was like almost like Avatar for
            me. I watched it, and then suddenly nothing is remembered.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Totally understandable.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. Actually, I also wanted to ask you about
            the character tags.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Catelyn Stark is almost nowhere to be
            found.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. This isn't a full list of the top
            characters, obviously. I sort of curated this a little bit. But, yeah. I don't think
            she's that popular. At least, on the whole. This is just on the whole. But, maybe in
            particular seasons she's more popular. Especially in the beginning, you know, before she
            dies.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Oh.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I know, so. That might be why.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. That's really interesting. And I'm pleased
            that Ellaria Sand makes the cut. She was, oh god, oh god...</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I definitely put her in there. That was part of
            my curation.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I was just so happy when I saw who
            was going to play her when that news came out. Because it was just a beautiful
            performance. I just really did love it.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> I'm also surprised that Daenerys Targaryen is,
            like, what? Fifth?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. I think I was most surprised that Jaime
            and Brienne were all around the most popular ship. I mean, it makes sense.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> But it's just like, "Whoa."</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. I mean, it is surprising. I mean, I think
            they, yeah. They've been consistently performing. Jon and Sansa kind of like came and
            went, fairly quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> They had their moment.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. It's really, really interesting. And
            Margaery Tyrell also makes... Oh, my god. Bran Stark is higher than Margaery Tyrell. The
            more that you read. Why is Loras Tyrell is higher than Oberyn Martell? I mean,
            okay.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. I think if it was, again, around Season
            Five, he'd probably be higher. Because I think people were upset about his
            death.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Oh, definitely. Loras Tyrell died before that,
            didn't he? In like Season Three?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Did he?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Even before that.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Damn. I don't know. I mean, yeah, it makes
            sense. I think also because he's a queer character, people might have been more
            interested in him, too.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's true.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> But I mean, Oberyn Martell is amazing. I love
            him. And I love the actor so much.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> True, true. But, yeah. I mean, it's very
            interesting to me to see how the ships, and especially the tropes that are used within
            the fandom that kind of pan out over seasons on end.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia081')">Because, I think one of
            the major ones is fluff.<span class="popuptext" id="dia081">Code: fluff</span></span></span> Right? Yeah. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia082')">I mean, you do
                see a lot of angst, though.<span class="popuptext" id="dia082">Code: angst</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, of course. There's got to be
            angst.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> It's fanfiction.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> It's Game of Thrones fanfiction.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> It's everywhere. I think angst is like the most
            popular tag, actually, in Archive of Our Own right now. And maybe Alternate Universe.
            But, I think angst is up there.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Definitely. But also, Sansa Stark being the most
            character person is not something that I hadn't expected. But definitely surprising in
            how much more. I think she's, what? Almost double Daenerys'?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> More than double. Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. I think from what I'm seeing, people
            really relate to Sansa, too. You know? I mean, I know I do.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah, definitely.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> But I think Sansa goes through something that a
            lot of young people, especially young women, go through. And I think your fic also
            captures that a lot. That sort of like wrestling of your gender, and how you have to
            perform in specific ways, and how that isn't really something that you question until
            you come up to this moment where you have to question it. You know?</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. I mean, yeah. I think that's a really,
            really beautiful way of putting it.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Oh, thank you.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia083')">Yeah, I mean, I think
            <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia116')">when I was first getting into the fandom,
                    one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
                    strong.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia116">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span> And it's true to a great extent. But I think what's
                even more fascinating to me, is how a lot of them tend to show that strength in so
                many different ways. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia117')">Like, you have Sansa, who
                    is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
                    of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
                    conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
                    world.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia117">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span> And then you have people like Margaery Tyrell and Cersei
                Lannister,<span class="popuptext" id="dia083">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span> who, actually, Cersei Lannister isn't even on this</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I might not have included her, that might be
            why. I had limited space, so this is a very, again, curated.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I think she is in the top, but I think I just
            excluded her.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> You don't like her very much.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I actually love Cersei, but also hate her. I
            love to hate her, sort of thing.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> She's a great character. She had a terrible
            Season Eight. I mean, everyone had a terrible Season Eight.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> That's true. Except for Sansa, to be
            fair.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yes.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Sansa had a wonderful ending.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> No, Sansa just owned it. Sansa and Arya were
            both great.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> True, true. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia084')">I actually do remember how unhappy people were that Sansa didn't
                end with a love interest at the end of Season Eight.<span class="popuptext" id="dia084">Code: canon-critique, fan-politics</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> And it was just so weird to me. Because it felt
            to me like if you added a love interest... Like, Arya ended up with a love interest.
            Because she had been with Gendry for ages. And that was kind of a brewing thing, that
            slowly kind of grew and everything. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia085')">But Sansa, she
                didn't have any such love interests. I mean, obviously, I was shipping her with Jon
                and everything. But there was no actual canonical basis for that on any
                level.<span class="popuptext" id="dia085">Code: canon-resistant</span></span></span> And I'm going to die on that hill. I mean, any other person that she
            might have had any kind of relationship with. She didn't have anything at all throughout
            Season Seven and Season Eight. The was the only one she had any sort of, that kind of
            thing, was Petyr Baelish. And, obviously, he got that killed. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia086')">I
                think it's just a relief to see how... Because to me, it's almost like a moment of
                such growth, is what I felt, when I felt Sansa. Because when you're young,
                    <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 01:20:56]</span>. You want the perfect marriage, and
                the perfect husband, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't mean that
                you'll necessarily get it. And to me, at least, growing up is balancing those
                childhood desires, and those childhood needs with whatever you learn as you grow up.
                <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia118')">And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
                    child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
                    sure that nobody hurt her.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia118">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="dia086">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span> Which, I think, is one of the
            major things that she had decided on after Ramsay, and after everything that happened
            with Ramsay. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia087')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia119')">And I think
                    there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
                    liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
                    everything.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="dia119">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="dia087">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia088')">And, obviously, there's a ton of other problems. How [inaudible
                01:21:42] Daenerys, and Cersei, and Jaime. And a number of other characters.<span class="popuptext" id="dia088">Code: canon-critique</span></span></span>
            But I do think that in that sense, they weren't too far off the mark. But I also
            acknowledge at the same time, that Sansa is the biggest kind of person in the show who
            had gone through such a physically demeaning and horrible experience under Ramsay. And
            suddenly they kept her away. And they basically said, "She's going to be the pure person
            who doesn't have any sort of relationship with whoever the hell."</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia089')">And I could understand why people felt unhappy about it. But at the same time, I
                think you're beating on the wrong bush here. There's a lot of other problems to deal
                with within this fandom. And within this canon that we don't particularly need as
                much as you're putting into it.<span class="popuptext" id="dia089">Code: canon-critique, fan-politics</span></span></span> But, yeah. I think otherwise it's just,
            yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'dia090')">Tyrion is
                surprisingly popular to be honest. I didn't think that he'd be as... I knew he'd be
                popular as a character. But not a person on Archive of Our Own. I didn't think that
                AO3 people would write a lot about him.<span class="popuptext" id="dia090">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span> And I don't mean that in
            a...</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. I was interested in that, too. I don't
            know if he's sort of a main character in people's fics, or if he's kind of a background
            character. Who knows? So, that would be something I would be interested in looking at,
            too. Yeah, I actually didn't realize that him and Brienne of Tarth appear in the almost
            same amount of fics. Well, I guess, she's probably at 5500 and he's probably at
            5000.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> A little bit more.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> But, still. That is interesting.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, because I can definitely think of a
            lot more <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 01:23:51].</span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. I'm like, "What are you doing there,
            Tyrion?" Who knows.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> All right.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Why don't you tell me about your dissertation?
            What made you decide to look into the fandom?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Sure. Hold on, I'm going to stop the recording
            for a second.</p>
        <p><strong>dialux:</strong> Okay.</p>
