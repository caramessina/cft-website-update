        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So today on February 16, 2020, I am interviewing Aria.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> I'll be going by Aria today, and I am agreeing to be interviewed.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Excellent, all right. So I'm going to start with asking you a few questions about yourself as a fan fiction writer, and a writer in general. So can you tell me a little bit about yourself as a fan fiction writer, when and how you started writing, which fandoms you started with, how do you participate in fandoms, how did your participation change over the years, and what fandoms do you currently participate in and why?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> There are like, two beginnings of me writing fanfic, back when I was like 10 or so I put something <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:00:47]</span> fandom that was really bad, it had some comedy that just wasn't funny, although you can't touch it <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:00:54]</span>. But when I was like 12, 13, 14, I started writing for real in the Digimon fandom, and that's where I learned how to write, and I really... In some sense I learned a lot about just writing in general, not just as a creative writer, as the basics of how do you do put together long compositions? Because at that point I was <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:01:31]</span>. So I obviously wrote Legend of Korra later in life, for a while. I wrote in the RWBY fandom for a while. I wrote in the Homestuck fandom for quite a long time, although pretty much after Homestuck was dead. Nowadays I'm not writing as much in any fandom, just because I don't have as much time as I used to and also, I don't know, the Homestuck fandom's kind of... It was a kind of a set of epilogues, that I liked and disliked the <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:02:02]</span> but also they... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar001')">Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters have been changed, and I was like, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar002')">"I can't really write this story about two women in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar002">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus heteronormativity</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar001">Code: canon-critique, motivation</span></span></span> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar003')">I don't want to be like, "Ah, but I'm writing the version of this character that's a woman." I hate that. I know that that's permissible with the meta text but I don't want to be part of that.<span class="popuptext" id="ar003">Code: fan-politics, identity-bending</span></span></span> I guess I want to leave that <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:02:36]</span> and I'll write some of my own original stuff with some of the consitency of that. And with engagement, I don't know, I used to be more generally engaged with the fandom, but <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar005')">mostly I felt like I wound up just getting in like an extension of me arguing on the internet, which is not a super-healthy way of engaging with communities.<span class="popuptext" id="ar005">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span> So I write still sometimes, but I try to engage less with fandoms because otherwise it's just going to be me arguing on the internet.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Can you talk a little bit more about that engagement that leads to arguments, and those tensions?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> They still have a lot of... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar006')">People write political theory when they write fan fic, like a lot of fan fic is political theory, a lot of fanfiction is political.<span class="popuptext" id="ar006">Code: important-quote, fan-politics</span></span></span> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar007')">People are like, "Oh..." When people talk about RWBY, the way they talk about the White Fang is the way they talk about radical politics. And I don't know if they realize it, but I always get really annoyed, because this is like bad political theory. It's very normal American political theory, but it's also bad. It's very much like, "Oh, there's no justification for violence," it's like, "I don't agree."<span class="popuptext" id="ar007">Code: fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span> And so, I don't know, that's not a healthy way of getting involved in it. From my view, is when I do it, almost like... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar008')">When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place, arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.<span class="popuptext" id="ar008">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, critical-uptake, motivation</span></span></span> It's like, I could do that, or I could just write, or I could argue about those things that are political and real, and double down on <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:04:30]</span>, you know?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great, give me one sec, I'm just writing something down. Okay, great, thank you. All right, so you said you haven't really written as much fan fiction recently, but what texts have you produced recently?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> In the last couple years I wrote a couple pieces, oh, I just haven't wrote a lot in the last six months, I got a job. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar009')">But I wrote a piece called Addict's Alchemy, which was a piece about...in terms of servicing some of the same things we're talking about today. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar010')">It's a piece about about trauma... And it [inaudible 00:05:20], that this isn't obviously. It's a piece about trauma and it's a piece about, what does it mean... Really they're both pieces about what it means to be disabled.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar010">Systems of Power: disability</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar009">Code: reflection</span></span></span> Although this is obviously a bit more than that, but that was... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar011')">And then I wrote a piece called <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:05:42]</span>, which was sort of like a revisiting of what does... <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar012')">I guess it was actually about immigration, it's just I never really ever got around to doing a piece about immigration system, but somebody had a bad take about immigration in America in a piece of fanfic and I was like, "God, that's a really bad understanding of that friend. That is utopian and wrong."<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar012">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar011">Code: fan-politics, critical-uptake</span></span></span> It mostly did, it didn't ever get finished though because it was like I'm the type of person that <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:06:09]</span> that I was writing about as to impact the story I was telling. It was like, "This story's dead, that's a real life <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:06:18].</span>"</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. Okay, awesome. So I'm going to ask you about your actual fic that we're talking about, Through Pain and Oppression. So can you talk a little bit about the motivation behind writing this fic?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> I think there were like a couple, I mean there was a couple of fics about being two things a lot, because that's sort of the thing that makes it both live and die. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar013')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar014')">For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the context around Stonewall,<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar014">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> and<span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar015')"> also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate, and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother you.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar015">Systems of Power: disability abelism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar013">Code: important-quote, canon-critique, critical-uptake canon-resistant, motivation</span></span></span> And I found that... and it was also a piece like, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar016')">I was coming into my own politically, I was becoming my own political individual in a way I hadn't been before. Like I had politics, but this is around the time that I'm really radicalized, and just me engaging with those contexts.<span class="popuptext" id="ar016">Code: critical-uptake, motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Can you talk a bit about some of the strengths of this fic?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> I don't remember it as well as I might, so I probably don't have as strong a... I can't really read things that are this old, because they're a little bit hard to read as a writer. But I remember it being both a piece where I took a lot of interesting concepts, and also a piece that I remember getting to a point where I told a story about... It was a statement about really hard dramatic <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:08:52]</span>. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar017')">This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting," instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that I really was not before.<span class="popuptext" id="ar017">Code: genre-other, reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. And what about some challenges you might have faced?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> I have a couple of challenges. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar018')">First of all <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar019')">I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it, as a writer. I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's beneficial or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it now, but I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy. I know I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized, and I didn't say that obviously in the tags.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar019">Systems of Power: other disability</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar018">Code: reflection</span></span></span> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar020')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar021')">But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They weren't things I was writing about at the time.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar021">Systems of Power: disability</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar020">Code: canon-critique canon-relation, motivation</span></span></span>  And the worst challenge that I had, it was just too epic. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar022')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar023')">It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make those two pieces meld at the time.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar023">Systems of Power: disability LGBTQplus</span></span></span> The story arcs just never came together, and I couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing I was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.<span class="popuptext" id="ar022">Code: genre-other, reflection</span></span></span> <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:10:46].</span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. Great, so can you talk maybe about any feedback that you received on this text, and that could be if you had someone read it that you sent it to, or any comments you got?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> I didn't get that much in the way of feedback on the written text. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar024')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar025')">I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar025">Systems of Power: disability other</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar024">Code: research revising</span></span></span> And almost, as an older writer I wish I had gotten some feedback, but also as an old writer I <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:11:32]</span> have that sense of myself as an individual dealing with trauma. And so that story didn't... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar026')">But that was the biggest bit of feedback I got was this conversation, and it helped a little bit.<span class="popuptext" id="ar026">Code: reception</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome, all right. I'm going to ask just about some additional tags that you used to tag. So you had angst, fluff, romance, PTSD, and homophobia. So can you talk about why you chose these additional tags in particular?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar027')">So I guess the first three, they're basic tags. You want to read angst, here's angst. You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance.<span class="popuptext" id="ar027">Code: fluff angst</span></span></span> And the other two, they're both thematic right. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar028')">And then the last one's a content warning, like yeah, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar029')">if you read this you'll see homophobia. I can't not publish a story about homophobia.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar029">Systems of Power: homophobia-transphobia</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar028">Code: authors-note, audience</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. All right. So I just have some general questions about content as well as just sort of different choices that you made. So my first is, why did you decide to focus on Korra and Asami, particularly after Season Three?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar030')">I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters. I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short, but it felt more like a nod than a full<span class="popuptext" id="ar030">Code: canon-compliment, motivation</span></span></span>...<span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar031')"> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's there in the text, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar032')">it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love feeling represented."<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar032">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> So I wrote that.<span class="popuptext" id="ar031">Code: canon-relation, canon-compliant, motivation</span></span></span> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar033')">I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this looks like? And so that's why I chose that.<span class="popuptext" id="ar033">Code: important-quote, canon-critique, critical-uptake, motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. So how come you decided then also to do alternative points of view?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar034')">I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll do alternate points of view."<span class="popuptext" id="ar034">Code: genre-other, reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. And then, so you talked about this a little bit, but I was wondering if you'd talk a little bit more about, why was it important for you to focus on politics in their romance?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I have <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:15:06] </span>politics is also kind of arguing on the internet, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar035')">but this is what I was doing with my life. I was on my way to running a queer resource center at a college, so I was doing the work of feeling the political implications of things in the world.<span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar036')"> And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about is to write about... Not just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia, not just homophobia, but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because this was the thing that was radicalizing me<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar036">Systems of Power: homophobia-transphobia LGBTQplus</span></span></span>, <span class="inaudible">[inaudible]</span> is vile, because... <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar037')">And it was about violence, so I don't just mean violence as a method of resistance, I mean violence as a thing that people survive.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar037">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span> Because that's what's radicalizing me at the time. And so I felt the need to wake up that in a sense.<span class="popuptext" id="ar035">Code: important-quote, motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. And then, oh, there's a second part of my question. It's fine, you answered it already. So you also, in the text, navigate between real-time and flashbacks quite often. So can you talk a little bit about why including flashbacks was such an important thing to do?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar038')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar039')">I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar039">Systems of Power: disability</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar038">Code: canon-compliant, motivation</span></span></span> <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:16:46]</span>. At the time, I think I was talking to someone who experienced flashbacks, one of the people that's involved <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:16:46]</span> as a way they experience flashback. And so I was writing in that space. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar041')">I don't know if I thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought about it as a storytelling tool obviously that helps power <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:17:00]</span>, not necessarily about the story if it makes sense. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar042')">I wasn't telling you things that had happened in the past, to teach you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This is what's haunting the characters, this is what the characters can't escape from in a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes sense.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar042">Systems of Power: disability</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar041">Code: genre-other, reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Okay, awesome. So I'm going to ask about some specific moments in the text, so I have quotes there from the original text. As I ask questions, if you don't mind just reading them, just to remind yourself. So I was really interested in your author's note at the beginning, and so can you talk a little bit about why you found writing therapeutic, and then also what was triggering about it?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar043')">If I remember correctly, this was about writing about suicide. I had been in a fight for a very long time. And I was nearly constantly suicidal. And so writing this piece was an engaging... It was obviously triggering.<span class="popuptext" id="ar043">Code: authors-note</span></span></span> And I think I took something I had experienced, like one of the <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:18:37]</span> to do that is almost always triggering, right? But it's also somewhat therapeutic, because this is an engagement, and here I am playing with <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:18:49]</span>. So I don't know, it was a complicated experience. I think it was mostly a good one, but I am relieved... This is not the piece... I remember trying to do this again later, more detailed and coming away really badly traumatized writing a piece that was more directly about political ideology, and that was <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:19:10]</span>. And honestly I'm glad I did it. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar045')">It was a piece that was sufficiently about me that it would have been fun and helpful for a lot of people. But this, I think it was a good piece, it was a piece that was a whole other world to read<span class="popuptext" id="ar045">Code: audience</span></span></span>, even if it was a piece about what I <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:19:36]</span>.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. So can you talk a little bit about some of the cultural and regional expectations you decided to incorporate, for example around food, around gender roles, around queerness and sexualities?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> Yeah. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar046')">So I was under the impression, reading or engaging with this text, I came away with this feeling like the Northern Water Tribe is somewhat... very different from the rest of the world, and there are ways that it plays as... I don't know if it was textual or sort of fan-driven more, but <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar047')">I remember coming away with this feeling that there is a marginalized subjectivity in the Northern Water Tribe. And so telling this story about difference in culture<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar047">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span>, and we'll get to... I'll get to Korra's upbringing a little bit later, because you're going to ask about 10 minutes later about Korra's upbringing. But I want to... <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar048')">Basically that I think Korra's upbringing is particularly reflective of that culture, yeah.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar048">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar046">Code: implicit-explicit critical uptake</span></span></span> Because it's like, I would imagine telling a story where it's like... That's complicated in a kind of metropolitan, cosmopolitan city, like Republic City. Because there's, I don't know. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar049')">I come away from Korra feeling like, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar050')">"This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy that there's not homophobia in a world with gender in the like weird way that... In ways that still reflect our I think gender and homophobia <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:21:13]</span>, the way that we have a sense of gender. Big, capital G Gender. And so I thought like, "What does it mean to have culture in the context of... What does it mean to be a cosmopolitan city where... There's both a degree of marginalization for like the Northern Water Tribe closing... Not so much that rules that are really intended to enforce gender norms are going to be there. And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a different understanding of gender in context," yeah.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar050">Systems of Power: heteronormativity cultural-difference</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar049">Code: important-quote, critical-uptake implicit-explicit</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> You also asked about cooking under this?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I did, yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar051')">Asami probably can't like cook...because I think it's either canonical or in fanon, and I kind of like that, because I like the notion that... I like the notion that someone who's very good at some things, but just not good at other things.<span class="popuptext" id="ar051">Code: implicit-explicit</span></span></span> Like she'd chosen to be good at certain things, and it also reflects sort of the expectation Hiroshi had for her, which we're also going to get to later because you're going to ask me about it.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Awesome, all right. So next question, Korra's lack of education around non-hetero or queer sexualities is super interesting. So why did you imagine Korra having that lack of education, and how do you relate that to our reality and world?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar052')">I think that this is a piece that comes from a weird part of what I understood about that world. To me, Korra grows up in a compound with people who are older than her, who aren't likely to tell her the truth about things. Because the White Lotus is an organization of people who are fundamentally keeping her apart. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar053')">And I remember being like, "Oh, these folks are not going to tell a child about queer sexuality." Particularly sexuality is a hard topic, you grow up in that kind of compound in a world where queer identities are looked down on, you're going to come away with this very strange view about that. And you might just be told nothing.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar053">Systems of Power: homophobia-transphobia</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar052">Code: implicit-explicit</span></span></span> And so the compound is the perfect institution <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:23:43]</span>, it's a place where a child is genuinely given an upbringing where other children aren't involved the <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:23:53]</span>. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar054')">I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family institutions. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar055')">My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community college is like, getting that <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:24:12]</span>.

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. So can you talk a little bit about writing about Korra's healing process from her physical wounds, learning to live with her trauma, and then Asami's role in all of that?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> Yeah. I don't remember exactly what I was thinking, and I do know the answer that came to mind just now. So I'm probably going to say things that aren't necessarily exactly in the text, because I've had more meditations on this since. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar056')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar057')">I was trying to write a story that engaged with trauma and felt authentic and didn't make trauma seem like the end of the world. Because the binary that's in a lot of literature is either like, "Oh, you either overcame trauma, or you are doomed to misery forever." And I was trying to find some middle ground, trying to tell a story that felt authentic.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar057">Systems of Power: disability</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar056">Code: important-quote, motivation</span></span></span> Because I neither feel like I recover, nor feel like I...

I feel that...actually I might like that a lot actually in context I have to... But that's a very, very, very extreme bit of jarring, and I... Because I tend to want my characters to want to know what's real, and that it is the most important thing going on that they do know what's real. But that's also possibly that I have more experience with being unsure of what what's real. I kind of understand that feeling, one of the most jarring thing to write. Like, "I do not know if that was real."</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. So can you talk a little bit about how the difference in the perspectives between Asami's perspective and Korra's perspective, so why did you imagine them having such different experiences?</p>

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Maybe one question I'll ask is, can you talk a little bit about what you imagine Asami and Hiroshi's relationship like, and sort of how his bourgeois politics have shaped her?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> I'd always seen Hiroshi as a complicated man, or I did, which is that I saw him as sort of...I mean, all because he's... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar068')">In the context of this piece, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar069')">a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois radical is that I'm not going to have a <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:30:36]</span>, because I don't really have a sense of class politics at the time, or have the beginnings of that study<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar069">Systems of Power: class</span></span></span>. That's only beginning to be born<span class="popuptext" id="ar068">Code: implicit-explicit, motivation</span></span></span>. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar070')">So to me, Hiroshi's both a man that would destroy his children for the things he believes, and in some sense for his own power. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar071')">But also a man who genuinely is providing aid and comfort and resources for fighting for what he views as liberation, and that liberation's probably genuine at some level. I think it's fair to say that there is a political bender-like supremacy at the beginning. I mean there is, we know there's a bender supremacy at the beginning of Legend of Korra.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar071">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span> And so that's how I understand Hiroshi.<span class="popuptext" id="ar070">Code: important-quote, critical-uptake</span></span></span> Well Asami, I don't know how much Asami, in my view at least, incorporated her father's politics into her ultimate judgment about Hiroshi. Because ultimately, her judgements about Hiroshi are, "You are a man who tried to kill me, and also a man who is my father." And so that relationship is very much going to be about that. Neither of those things are things you can accept. You can build a... They could be changed by other factor, like you can come to forgive someone trying to injure you, or trying to kill you, or you can say, "I can no longer view you as my father." But you can't un-make the case that you lived with [<span class="inaudible">inaudible 00:32:24]</span>. And those are going to be as big as anything else, at least in my view.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great, thank you. So I was really interested in the extremes between Korra's parents and her in chapter three, where Korra's father is talking about being the leader of the Northern Water Tribe and what that sort of... His sort of views on queerness and criminalization of queerness. So can you talk a little bit about this exchange and the complexity of this exchange, of each of them sort of taking on different roles, and how those roles are not separate from each other, and all that?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> Yeah. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar072')">I wanted to give a sense of what is the politics of the Northern Water Tribe? <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar073')">And I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water Tribe, or is not criminalized anymore.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar073">Systems of Power: homophobia-transphobia</span></span></span> Also I wanted to say this is a different relationship. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar074')">But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give up for their family, and what are they not?<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar074">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar072">Code: critical-uptake, motivation</span></span></span> Because one of the things I'm saying here is, I'm not saying...

        <p><strong>aria:</strong> Tonraq?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> That sounds right? Yes, Tonraq, yes.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> Tonraq, I'm not saying that Tonraq believes the things he's saying, that he said he would say to begin with, that section about... Or he didn't believe it in a hurtful way, just that it wasn't worth it, and telling the story that... It seemed like well now you're involved, now my child is involved... In some sense I guess I'm telling a story about Hiroshi here as well, just Hiroshi here comes into play again. Sort of like the opposite of what Hiroshi does, in that he's a parent who is not perfect, there's no innate... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar075')">He's not particularly flawed, because he's willing to play this opportunistic political game.

I sort of was thinking about the limits of the political and the <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:35:57]</span> of the political. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar079')">You could do what, when and where, the idea that a politician can't really save the world.

And who feels free to do it? Because in some sense I think this is also about feeling free. It's not just about telling someone, "Oh, I don't want to do this, or I don't think I..." It's also like, "I don't think I can do this," versus like, "Well, if my daughter is involved I have to be able to." Yeah. I also had a bit of fun here with the, Korra knows nothing about the world, here when I... I don't know. Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. Great, thank you. I can definitely sort of see those complexities coming through, I thought that was such a well-done scene.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> Thank you.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So finally, can you talk a little about the introduction of... Is it Yukka, Yakka? I'm not sure how...</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> I don't know how to pronounce that, I took a name of a names list and I was like, "This has the appropriate cultural background," and the name we're going with, and thank goodness I do not have to read this out loud.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Until this moment, no.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> Until this moment I did not think, I am going to read this out loud.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So can you talk a little bit about the introduction of her? Yeah, and sort of what you were exploring, and what you were sort of planning to explore with her.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> Yeah. Well, no. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar080')">I<span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar081')"> was thinking about New York City around the times of the Stonewall Riots. This is where those politics come in. I was playing with, what does it mean... I was playing with, what's particularly violent political oppression? What are the limits of political oppression in a relatively liberal cosmopolitan society?<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar081">Systems of Power: homophobia-transphobia</span></span></span> Because I was getting that sense of, there's actually a whole lot of ways that political oppression can happen that I'd never even thought about at this point, and I was learning about that. So I was writing about this character as someone who's experiencing the limits of that political oppression. And this is actually one of the key storylines in my opinion, and it's ultimately a story about resistance to a kind of political oppression<span class="popuptext" id="ar080">Code: reflection</span></span></span>, and also a story about dealing...And the problem is that those stories <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:39:30]</span>, and this is very hard to make. And so this story was the beginning of a story about people getting caught up in more and more...

I guess writing a little bit about, how do we fight back when things get worse?<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar083">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar082">Code: reflection</span></span></span> Not that I really have an understanding of what things getting worse is actually going to be like, or what we were actually going to do, or what it was going to take to survive, or how it would change me, or how it would change people I cared about. Those were not things I understood, but I was trying.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. So maybe one question I'll ask that I don't have on here, so if you are kind of like, "I have no idea how to answer this," don't feel sort of pressured to. But if you were to rewrite this now, what would you change?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> I think I have... I haven't really watched The Legend of Korra again, to really get a sense ofthat. But something I do think is I'd write the last chapter first, or not the last chapter, the second last chapter. Specifically I write <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:41:17]</span>. I'm tempted to joke that I have rewritten the story and it took people about context, but that's not really true, it's not about disability, it's just about trauma. But I would <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:41:30]</span> and I would probably start with questions about what I think are fresh about political oppression in public today. I think I would write it later, I think I would write it... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar084')">Because I know what our reactionary politics is like, I think I'd start around the time that Kuvira is beginning to gain power. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar085')">I'd write it as a story that talks about immigration, and talks about sweeping panic and fear that spill off of that.

I'd probably both use modern messages to say that, I'd probably talk more about police state, and police state as endless spying networks where you don't know when you're being spied on and when you're not, and endless police states<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar085">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar084">Code: critical-uptake</span></span></span> where you don't know when you can literally get... You can literally push the cops back a block, and in situations where you <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:42:42]</span> grapple a cop and draw felony of both charges, that kind of uncertainty. I'd rate that that's the kind of thing I'd want to focus on more. But I'd also want to talk about trauma in the same way I did then. I think I'd want to draw trauma through as a thing that was happening. And I might not write it about <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:43:09]</span>, I love these characters, but I think a much smaller, much more human story, a story about a couple small people who are just living in the world, watching everything happen and... I kind of think that prose, when I tell a story about Republic City and trauma and repression. I think that's what I would do.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great, thank you.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> No problem.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So the last question I have about the fanfic, your fanfic specifically, is what did you learn from writing this?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> I mean, I worked on a lot of things, I was a writer who felt... I felt comfortable with my writing in a way that I hadn't before. I learned that having people who shared the piece with immediately helped, and that having people I talked through a piece with makes it more fun to write. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar086')">I also learned that you have to be careful with how much to take on, and you have to be careful about what you're willing to prune, and you have to be ready to prune things. And you have to be ready to follow a story where it goes instead of trying to follow all the directions you ever imagined. Because if you try to follow a story in every direction you have, then it's going to die like this piece did. It's like, "I don't know how to integrate the story into itself anymore."<span class="popuptext" id="ar086">Code: revising</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. All right, so my last portion is about... I'm doing some sort of larger data analytics and such. So I included some visualizations that I've made using some of the metadata from fics, so like publish date, and the relationship tags, the additional tags, and then also results from a word embedding model. So I was wondering-</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> Mm-hmm. You're going to have to explain the word embedding model to me when we get there.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Oh, great, excellent. Yeah, I will absolutely explain that, so don't worry. My main questions are revolving around, how do these different results reflect your experience in the Legend of Korra fan community, and what might you think are missing from these results? So the first visualizations are obviously just publishing trends, when there were publishing spikes and when people were not publishing fics. So obviously there's a huge spike in late 2014, when Season 4 aired. So why do you think people began to publish so much after Season 4?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> I would say that it's just one of those... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar087')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar088')">This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons, a relatively good one.

I think it's one of the cases where that's happened. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar089')">Also I think it's when fiction ends, it does draw people who are like, "Oh, I want to write more on this subject, I want to play with these concepts again." There's also a distinct un-ended-ness<span class="popuptext" id="ar089">Code: fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span>, a distinct lack of ending between Korra and Asami at the end of the... And I think it's actually both good and bad, I think it's the limit of the... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar090')">I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad. But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that! I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.<span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:47:08]</span> what are other ways we can imagine it?<span class="popuptext" id="ar090">Code: canon-compliment, fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span>  What if their <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:47:13]</span>. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar091')">And that creates fanon, which means you get this whole long space of people being like, "Oh yeah, I am writing about this content of fanon in this alternate universe, I'm going to write a piece about a radio show<span class="popuptext" id="ar091">Code: fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span> <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:47:28]</span>, I'm going to..." <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar092')">It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:47:39]</span>, some of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion that comes out of that. So I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and I think that it's liberating for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.<span class="popuptext" id="ar092">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, great. So the second visualization is relationship tags across time. So Korra and Mako are one of the most popular relationships in earlier fics, and Asami and Korra became one of the most popular ships in later fics. So why do you think that difference happened?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> I'm actually really interested in...<span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar093')">Just real quick, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar094')">I'm really interested in the fact that Korra and Mako becomes more common after Korrasami happened.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar094">Systems of Power: heteronormativity</span></span></span> That, to me, is just fascinating.<span class="popuptext" id="ar093">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span> But I would say my biggest... It's just total number? So I would think I have about this whole... If they're coming to a piece and they're like, "Well this is canonical," it's a good introduction. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar095')">Also, if you're looking at a subtext, my people they were like, "Oh yeah, I want to tell this story, I want to finish this story." <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar096')">And there's a degree to which it a queer reading, there's this political tendency to look at fiction and say, "I am going to tell the story you didn't."<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar096">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> And so during the subtext period, you've already got these people who are basically being like, "Yo, I'm going to tell this story.<span class="popuptext" id="ar095">Code: fan-politics, implicit-explicit</span></span></span> I'm going to <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:49:26]</span> the story gets old while I wait. What? Oh my God, that's so cool. I didn't know it did that." </p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Excellent, thank you. And so the next visualization are just some popular additional tags. Okay, so these are just additional tags, they're not the most popular tags, I sort of curated these, especially down at the bottom. I'm interested in why particular additional tags are picked up more in particular moments. So fluff at Season One and Two was not used nearly as much as it was in Season Three and beyond. So why do you think that might be?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> Mm-hmm. I think there's a degree to which people want to write. I've got to look <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:50:59]</span> saying. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar097')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar098')">Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just, "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar098">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus feminism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar097">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, critical-uptake, fluff</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. And then for angst, it became more popular, again, in Season Four and beyond, so... Not beyond, just Season Four. So why might you think that might be?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> Possibly people want to tell stories about being in pain. I don't know how many of these are fluff and angst telling, because I know I have a fluff and angst story. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar099')">And I don't know, I don't know if I'd use the fluff and angst tags anymore, just because I don't talk about my literature in those terms as much anymore, as I used to, but... Largely because nobody...You don't use those tags as much anymore in my view, like we don't talk about... Those are very much Fanfiction.net-y terms that pulled over, I don't see them as I used to.<span class="popuptext" id="ar099">Code: fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span> But I think that a story that is... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar100')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar102')">I think that people writing about suffering and happiness, a lot of things happen in love stories in general, particularly in WlW and MlM stuff.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar102">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> Well, I don't know if MlM, I don't read it very much just because one, I am not a man, and two,<span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar101')"> so much MlM stuff is kind of uncomfortable? A lot it's very clearly written by women.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar101">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar100">Code: fan-politics, angst</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great, thank you. So canon compliance-</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> In the modern days.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, the modern setting is very popular. So canon compliant became much more popular, Season Three and beyond. Why do you think that might be?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> I've got a few guesses, my first guess is actually that it's not just that it became more popular, but looking at the modern setting stuff, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar103')">First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant," as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now. That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra<span class="popuptext" id="ar103">Code: canon-compliant, genre-other</span></span></span>.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great, excellent. And then the tag friendship became less popular after seasons one and two, and so I was wondering if you had any thoughts about why that might have happened.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> Kind of sad. I don't know why. I imagine that both there were things that were being told with friendship stories stopped being friendship stories, but that's not enough to explain that much difference. I imagine the change is in writing, I imagine it's that the characters... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar104')">I imagine that it's because... It makes sense to tell a friendship story with characters who are already very close friends, and characters who are becoming close friends.<span class="popuptext" id="ar104">Code: canon-compliant</span></span></span> I don't know. I don't know how to guess <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:55:41]</span> because I'm like, "I don't know why you wouldn't be excited to tell friendship stories." I'm not telling them in this piece, and I don't basically tag friendship stories. But I don't know why... Yeah..</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Mm-hmm. Okay. So one other question I had, and this is the last one, so canon queer relationship became popular after Season Four. But Canon Character of Color became less used.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> That's a problem.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yes, and I thought that was very interesting.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> That is strange. I don't know if a lot of the folks who...is this a ratio or total amounts?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Of all of the-</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> These numbers, these tags across time, are you looking at the total--</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> It's the ratio, yeah. So it's not the total amounts, it's the ratio.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> So there's a few guesses I have. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar106')">I mean, canon queer relationship is more common because there is canon queer relationship.<span class="popuptext" id="ar106">Code: canon-compliant</span></span></span> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar105')"> a <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:57:08]</span> of the audience that come later are less interested in acknowledging or talking about race. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar106')">Given this is a proportion, I don't know if <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:57:24]</span> but more people as a fandom and those few people aren't interested in talking about race in ways that people who had been there before were, and those people who were there before continued to talk about race, or if there is an effectively gentrifying mmoment that a white fandom comes in, pushes out a fandom of color.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar106">Systems of Power: racism</span></span></span> I don't know how this tag is used, so I would feel hesitant to say something definite. But I find that a little bit troublesome.<span class="popuptext" id="ar105">Code: fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. That we're talking about, I'm thinking the two... I know that at one point, I've seen some canon queer character of color, so that could have been a potential replacement too, now that we're talking about... Yeah. So that's something I'm going to actually look into more. Okay, all right. So we'll talk about the word embedding models. So word embedding models are pretty much, every word in a text is given a bunch of different vectors, and these vectors are determined by other words in the text that appear in similar contexts. So the word wolf and dog might have a really close relationship, because they are going to appear in similar contexts, around howling and treats and fur and four legs, so depending on the text obviously. So that's sort of what a word embedding model is, it measures how similar words are in regards to the context that they show up in a particular text. So the pre-Korrasami corpus are all the texts published before Season Three, subtextual is all the texts that were published Season Three and four, and then post-Korrasami is after Season Four finale. So I'm interested to see if you have any thoughts about this, like for example the word girlfriend, at first, it's sort of seen as a similar relationship with boyfriend, and jealous, and date, and cute. And then meanwhile as it moves forward we see girlfriend as Korra and Asami, as a dork, as a door. So I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of those results.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> Actually that's a very interesting bit, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar107')">because it looks to me here that what <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar108')">you're seeing is a movement from seeing the word girlfriend in a context of a text that's about a set of texts about relationships in a more heterosexual perspective, in a story about women. Because it looks to me that this is a story that, if you see jealous there, that looks like I'm looking at a piece that's from Korra's point of view. But then if I'm looking at boyfriend, I'm also thinking about Korra and Mako.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar108">Systems of Power: heteronormativity</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ar107">Code: fan-politics, canon-compliant</span></span></span> They also use the word date, there was some interesting... You'd see date here, and you'd see date in the next panel and not on the last. In the middle one you see... I don't know, it's almost completely... Definitely gendered, you don't get just... When you're using the word cute, and you see the word chuckle and wink, which is like...I don't know, I guess it's basically a few words like... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar109')">The context is basically just, yeah, things you would expect people would say on a date, things you'd expect people to do on a date, things that writers do when they run out of words, like chuckle.<span class="popuptext" id="ar109">Code: fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span> You can talk so fast. I don't know half the time though. And then on the last bit, Korra and Asami, the internet <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 01:02:04]</span> girlfriend in the next chapter that they're talking about this relationship, they're talking about the way they imagined these two people to relate. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar110')">Also this more mature understanding of a relationship, seeing their partner as a dork versus like, seeing them as cute. And obviously you see your partner is cute for a long time after you start dating, that... Viewing someone as a dork is a more developed sense of what a relationship is.<span class="popuptext" id="ar110">Code: fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. So there's a few other results, if you want to sort of look them over and see if there's anything that pops out to you. And if not, you don't need to go through them, but I'll give you a second to look over.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> I am baffled by what is going on with masculine.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> How come?</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> The last panel made sense, the first panel? I don't really follow, but I kind of follow. It's just an attraction to masculinity. And then the second panel, I get... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar111')">That's an interesting set of outcomes, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar112')">just looking at masculinity as almost sexual in the middle there, an almost dangerous. Because a person's understanding of masculinity are sexual, like the second one is a kind of dangerous, like a kind of danger<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar112">Systems of Power: heteronormativity</span></span></span>. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar113')">Versus like the sexuality in the second one, for feminine as well as that same panel, but it's not like dangerous<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar113">Systems of Power: heteronormativity</span></span></span>... That's very interesting, it's very interesting that the middle section feels just more sexual in general. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar114')">I was laughing at the bottom set for heiress in the middle column, "a-asami" there.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar114">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> It's like, I guess? <span class="popuptext" id="ar111">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span>Literally [inaudible 01:04:53].</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative), yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>aria:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar115')">And to be fair, omega and alpha as being there in the far right column. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ar116')">I don't really understand ABO [alpha, beta, omega] as in general, so I can't talk. They're not as inherently sexual. They definitely struck me as relatively sexual<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ar116">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span>, and that's not<span class="popuptext" id="ar115">Code: fan-politics, genre-other</span></span></span>... I guess Korra <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 01:05:06]</span>. But it's interesting there, that you see more discussion of sexuality in that column [inaudible 01:05:17].</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative). Excellent, that's a really, really good observation. Thank you. All right, so those are all the questions I have. So I'm going to turn off the recording.</p>
