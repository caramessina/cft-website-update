        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I'm going to start with a little bit of an
            introduction, just so when I'm listening back I can know everything and know all the
            details. So, today on Monday, January 13th, 2020, I am interviewing Kittya Cullen. So,
            while you've already signed this consent form, can you verbally confirm that you agree
            to have this interview audio recorded and the audio recording potentially published on
            my dissertation website? </p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> Yes, I agree to do this interview for the
            dissertation.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. And do you mind just stating your
            alias out loud?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> I used Kittya Cullen for this
            interview.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Perfect. Thank you. All right, so let's get
            started. Can you tell me a little about yourself as a fanfiction writer?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> I suppose at this point I've been writing for
            about seven years in fandom. Aside from that, I have dabbled back and forth in other
            things, but in terms of being a participant of fandom, it's been about seven years. I
            have been around, let's see, at least since 2006, but that wasn't really in terms of
            online fandom participation or anything of that sort. It was mostly just watching
            children reading books and being invested in them, but not necessarily having, let's
            say, a fandom community as we know it today. I mean, that makes sense given my age
            because at the time I would have been in my early teens, and where I lived it wouldn't
            have really been feasible to be involved in fandom in the way that I am now in terms of
            tweeting and writing and just being in discussions about meta and so on. In terms of
            just the process, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka001')">I think I started writing
                fan fiction in earnest because I was homesick. Because I had recently moved, and so
                it was with the intent of writing something that was close to home but also part of
                fandom that I started doing that.<span class="popuptext" id="ka001">Code: motivation</span></span></span> That was like early or mid 2012, '13,
            somewhere around there.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. So what was it about writing fan
            fiction and participating in the fandom that made you feel close to home?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> Well, it was more to do with the fandom that I
            was in at the time. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka002')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka063')">That was an Indian television show that I was
                    watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
                    because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
                    and so on.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka063">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ka002">Code: canon-relation</span></span></span> But when I moved here, it wasn't possible for
            me to do that at the time, so I found the back end ways of watching. And then I realized
            that while I could still watch it, I couldn't understand it. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka003')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka064')">So I got into forums and fans would
                    translate for those of us who didn't speak Hindi.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka064">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span> And obviously
                people would answer questions if you asked because you couldn't get everything in
                the translations or the summaries. And during that time, we would talk about the
                plot of the show, what the characters were doing, where we were expecting things to
                go at that time. It was just a lot of the basic things at fandom.<span class="popuptext" id="ka003">Code: fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. What was the name of the television
            show?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> That one was <span class="inaudible">[inaudible
                00:04:05]</span>. It was basically about remarriage. One of the characters was
            a widower and the other was a divorcee. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka004')">At the
                time that the show was airing, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka065')">it was kind of taboo for
                    divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
                    portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
                    it was a combination of really interesting things.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka065">Systems of Power: heteronormativity cultural-difference feminism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ka004">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span> I
            mean, I watched other shows at the time, but that one ... I guess it seemed to come
            along right at the cusp of me being able to participate in communities, so it was a game
                changer. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka005')">And because <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka109')">I grew up in a country
                where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian content was part of our
                regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened, so it shaped what I was
                interested in.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka109">Systems of Power: cultural-difference</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ka005">Code: canon-relation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. Thank you. So how did your
            participation then in the fan communities change over the years? And if you could talk a
            little about what fandoms you currently participate in and why you currently participate
            in those?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> Okay. I'd say it went from being casual in terms
            of, "I like this book or I like this show, and there are things that irritated me, but
            whatever, I can move on with my life." To-</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I know that feeling so well.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka006')">To
                realizing that there was a community of people who were also interested in
                discussing <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka110')">how these shows and books and games et cetera were failing us, whether it
                was in terms of the content or the representation or just releasing new things like
                thought arcs that weren't followed through on.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka110">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ka006">Code: fan-politics, critical-uptake</span></span></span> So, in terms of where I first
            began, it was I think probably <cite>Twilight</cite>, which tends to be a turning
            point for lots of people.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yep.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka007')">But I
                think with <cite>Twilight</cite> it was just that phase where you finally find a
                story that speaks to you, even if you kind of hate it when you look back at it when
                you're older. But at the time, how <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka066')">
                    Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
                    small community and so forth and deals with depression<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka066">Systems of Power: disability</span></span></span> or
                whatever it is, it just seemed to be something that I could relate to. And so
            I was both interested in that, and <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka111')">I guess in the power fantasy that she was written to
            come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
            characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka111">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ka007">Code: canon-relation, motivation</span></span></span> So there was an interest in just
            playing in that world and those powers and just the very idea of doing something fun.
                I think I stumbled upon those ... I can't
                think of what it's called, the English variety, because I did stumble upon it in my
                time in the Indian fanfictions and it was called something slightly different. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka008')">But
                basically where you would participate with one fan writing a line, the next fan
                writing another line and so on and so forth. So that was the first time that I
                actually wrote anything fandom related.<span class="popuptext" id="ka008">Code: genre-other</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Sort of like role playing?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> Yeah, role playing. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka009')">And then there was a bit of a lull until my delving into the
                Indian forums. And there we would do the meta analysis and satirical writings and so
                on. <span class="popuptext" id="ka009">Code: genre-other</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka010')">Actually, I completely forgot, there was a
                period where I would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because I
                don't do that anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment
                with writing and being critical of source materials and so on.<span class="popuptext" id="ka010">Code: critical-uptake, genre-other</span></span></span> It was, I
            don't know, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka011')">I guess you can say it was a
                nudge to move from passive consumption to active consumption.<span class="popuptext" id="ka011">Code: important-quote, fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. I have a few followup questions based
            on that. So when you first started answering, you talked about how something that really
            drew you to fanfiction and participating in fan communities. Is it ways in which shows
            were failing us, specifically around representation and content? And of course plot
            arcs, but isn't that always the case? And I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit
            about your experience with shows failing you, especially in terms of
            representation.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> Okay. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka012')">So I am currently in the <cite>Supergirl</cite> fandom, which has been a mess.
                I'm saying that nicely.<span class="popuptext" id="ka012">Code: criticism</span></span></span> I don't know that I was actually thinking about it in
            terms of shows at first. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka013')">I think it was more
                that it was very books for me because <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka067')">I grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on
                    South America but as socially, politically part of the Caribbean, so most of the
                    content that we were consuming was either shows from the US or whatever, maybe
                    European shows might have filtered through, and that also was the case for the
                    books that we were reading. And while it was the case within school for us to
                    consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to read Caribbean literature as a
                    person on my own.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka067">Systems of Power: cultural-difference racism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ka013">Code: canon-relation</span></span></span> I don't know. It was more common to
            find things like <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:10:54]</span> books or the
                <cite>Twilight</cite> series or <cite>Harry Potter</cite> and so on than, let's
            say, <cite>A Year in San Fernando</cite> or things like that, or anything from V.S.
            Naipaul and so forth. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka014')">So it was just discovering a collection of books in my
                own home from my aunt and my mother and so on, their teachers. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka068')">And my aunt in particular, she
                    teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
                    them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
                    were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
                    know. <span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka068">Systems of Power: cultural-difference racism</span></span></span>I guess it comes back to not knowing what you're missing
                until you finally have it. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka069')">So when I first read texts were people
                    were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living
                    in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et
                    cetera.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka069">Systems of Power: antiracism cultural-difference</span></span></span>
                <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka070')">Because even though I speak, let's say,
                    like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
                    home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
                    speak English, but it's a particular kind of English.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka070">Systems of Power: cultural-difference other</span></span></span> So just
                seeing that in text and then realizing that the fantasies and so on that I was
                consuming were ... I don't know, it had these strange things that just didn't quite
                compute with where I was living. That's where it really clicked for me. And from
                that point onward, I think that's where I began to see it in everything else. The
                biggest shift didn't really come until I moved to the US, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka071')">because back home I was part of the
                    majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing yourself in other
                    ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in the news as a
                    politician, et cetera<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka071">Systems of Power: antiracism cultural-difference</span></span></span>. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka072')">But here it was a completely different
                    ballgame, so it felt more insidious<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka072">Systems of Power: racism cultural-difference</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ka014">Code: important-quote, canon-relation</span></span></span>, I guess I can
            say.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you so much for answering these
            questions. So I'm going to move into talking about the specific fanfiction itself,
            Marching Ants, just because we're at 15 minutes. I want to make sure we get into really
            talking about your fic.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> Sure.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Can you describe your motivation behind writing
            The Marching of Ants? ... or Marching Ants. Sorry.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> This was almost five years ago, so it's
                <span class="inaudible">[crosstalk 00:14:03]</span>. But I think at the time it was that we
            had just finished the show. It had gone in a direction I was not expecting. In fact, my
            cousin was the one ... Let me see. Actually, no. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka016')">I
                was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
                happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka073')"> Given my own cultural background and
                    the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
                    that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka073">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus cultural-difference</span></span></span> ...
                Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If I
                could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
                been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
                how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.<span class="popuptext" id="ka016">Code: important-quote, canon-compliment, motivation</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka017')">But also the fics I had read after the
                show had finished seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ...
                Obviously, it was a really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had
                happened in the gap years that they hadn't shown us for Korra.<span class="popuptext" id="ka017">Code: fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span> And while I
            thought it was important, it sort of felt like with ATLA, with <cite>Avatar: The Last
                Airbender</cite>, we had the opportunity to see the inner workings of other
            integral characters who weren't necessarily main characters but still had really
            interesting internal happenings. And we didn't quite get to see that with Asami or Bolin
            or Mako, and <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka018')">I kind of wanted to see that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular,
                and this was surprising for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I
                never really remember to think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like
                there was this big gap available to us for exploration.<span class="popuptext" id="ka018">Code: implicit-explicit, motivation</span></span></span> I think I just also
            wanted to see what it was like for that character to lose someone who was so important
            to her and then to, I guess, have maybe her friends and so on drift away because the
            linchpin of that entire dynamic for them was no longer there. And just the community
            that she would have formed, let's say, with the airbending family and so on, even though
            they might have <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:16:55]</span> to talk to each other, I
            don't know if the intimacy and so on was still there.<span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka019')"> So I kind of wanted to explore that and see how
                Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for me I like to see how the characters
                are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to
                them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.<span class="popuptext" id="ka019">Code: implicit-explicit, motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. So what do you believe some of the
            strengths of your fic are?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka020')">For
                this particular fic, I think it was just the imagery. I was really trying to grasp
                something that in some ways is so intangible. I was trying so hard to get just that
                feeling of desolation and aching.<span class="popuptext" id="ka020">Code: reflection</span></span></span> In hindsight, now I think there was also
            just this ... And I think you ask about it in a later question. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka021')">But the metaphor itself of the Marching Ants, it was
                this way of articulating the anxiety that comes along with that.<span class="popuptext" id="ka021">Code: reflection</span></span></span> I don't
            know. I think depression itself is something that is more easily articulated than the
            anxiety that may come along with it because it's not so much that it's a starting point,
            but sometimes it's already a trigger event that has occurred. And so with Asami, I was
            looking at how loss had triggered that within her, and how that lost was manifesting
            physically and emotionally for her and also in how she was viewing the world. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka022')">So I think it
                just came back to capturing that, the imagery of it, the tone of the chapter, the
                voice of it because, at least to me, it works really hard to put us in Asami's shoes
                and make us experience it exactly as she's experiencing it.<span class="popuptext" id="ka022">Code: important-quote, reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. I'm going to skip over just a few
            questions. I'm going to jump to the questions about your tags. I was wondering if you
            could talk a little about why you use the particular tags, family, love, canon, related
            and relationships. Tags are really interesting because they're just a way for writers to
            sort of reach out and catch their audiences, so why did you decide to use those
            particular tags, and what other tags might you have used?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'k111')">Partly, I wasn't quite sure what tags to use
            because I was still learning.<span class="popuptext" id="k111">Code: fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span> It's still a learning curve. I still don't know
                <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:20:15]</span>. But at that time, I think there was
            just a focus on what, I now know, I might call found family. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka023')">And also on being canon-compliant,
                but still ... I was working in an area where there was nothing for canon yet. I'm
                assuming that with the comics now, we'll get more information on that regard. But at
                the time, there was nothing in that area. So I wanted it to be known that it was
                still within canon's bounds, but there were going to be things being explored that
                weren't articulated in canon.<span class="popuptext" id="ka023">Code: canon-compliant implicit-explicit</span></span></span><span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka024')">
                And in terms of relationships and love and so forth, it was I guess just coming back
                to what I like to explore in fiction, which is how people are interacting with each
                other, what it means for them. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka112')">And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
                not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
                audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
                exploration. <span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka112">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span>So I like to see for myself how their worth is existing within these
                relationships, what it means for them and what it can mean for the audience and so

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. Thank you. I like the mention of found
            family in particular. So you also answered the next question in a previous question,
            which is just about why you decided to write it after it aired, because you started
            watching it then. So maybe we'll jump to the specific moments in the text. So you talked
            a little bit about the marching ants metaphor as well. Do you want to expand on anything
            that you mentioned before with the marching ants metaphor?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> I think the only thing I'd probably add is that
            ... I don't know. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka025')">I guess the sensation of ants ... I come from an area
                where you commonly come into contact with animals and so on, so I'm familiar with
                the actual physical reality of ants crawling across your skin, and there's a way
                that it feels. It's like a sort of weird, prickling sensation that is very
                disconcerting, and I guess I wanted to translate that into how the story reflects
                Asami's own experience with whatever she's feeling. And that imagery just seemed to
                click with that, just the experience of having something under your skin and on your
                skin, even if you can't quite articulate what it is.<span class="popuptext" id="ka025">Code: reflection</span></span></span> Yeah, that's about
            it.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. Great. What drew you to write about
            Asami and her father's relationship? And I'm also going to add another question of, you
            talked a lot about sort of capturing feelings of loneliness and desolation, so what are
            you two writing about her relationship with her father and her found family and that
            sort of loneliness she's feeling?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka026')">With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
                came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
                that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.<span class="popuptext" id="ka026">Code: canon-compliment, motivation</span></span></span> Because I
            mean he had tried to kill her, and that is a pretty massive change in a relationship,
            especially when you consider how close they seem to be at the beginning of the series.
            Because it's just Asami and her father, and this is basically the only family that she
            has. And even when we meet Asami, and she gets to know the other people in Korra's
            circle, we see that Asami herself doesn't seem to have any other friends besides Korra
            and Mako and Bolin and the others in the Avatar community. So it was just that, I guess,
            how disconnected from everyone else she must have felt for her to have reached out to
            someone who harmed her so deeply, especially after she had gone with that much silence.
            And just also her reaction to Korra bringing it up when they meet again. I think there
            was just something about the way ... So, in Korra's reaction, we can see that there is
            care and concern, and Asami does get that, but she's also I guess maybe hurt or
            frustrated because Korra ... While Korra was absent from the world they had all made
            with each other, Korra did have her parents, and she's always had this community of
            people who are invested in her upbringing, her growth, whatever is going on in her life.
            So, even though Korra herself was experiencing this deeply traumatic, terrible thing,
            and just trying to recover and even just get back to walking, if that was possible for
            Korra at the time, she still had all these people who she could draw on. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka027')">Whereas, for
                Asami, Asami didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have
                anyone. So she went back to someone, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka074')">I
                    guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
                    for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
                    act of violence ...<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka074">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span> I don't know. I just wanted to explore
                that. It's just fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow
                still find a way to circle back around to the people who have hurt
            them.<span class="popuptext" id="ka027">Code: implicit-explicit, motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. So in your author's note, you
            mentioned the story begins after book three finale in part because, "When I first really
            connected to Korra, the avatar and the human." So why do you feel connected to Korra,
            both the avatar and the human?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka028')">I think
                in the first two books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I
                guess her experiences are fantastical in a sense.<span class="popuptext" id="ka028">Code: canon-critique</span></span></span> Up until that point, we had
            seen her dealing with things that most adolescents are not dealing with, politics to
            that degree where you are involved in the world stage, in the world stage's effect on
            the rest of the world and so on and having this massive responsibility where you are
            carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders. Even with the earlier series,
                <cite>Avatar: The Last Airbender</cite>, we don't really connect to some of the
            other characters until that episode where Zuko and Azula and Ty Lee and so on, they're
            on the beach and they're talking about how their parents treated them or how they
            reacted to their environment and so forth. We didn't really quite have a moment like
            that in <cite>The Legend of Korra</cite> because there wasn't time to do so. But when
            they allowed Korra's entire foundation to be shifted both physically and mentally, it
            changed something. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka029')">It was sort of ... To me,
                it was groundbreaking in how they handled that because <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka113')">we get to see Korra, who is
                this all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having
                this really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once
                had, and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to
                deal with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so
                forth.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka113">Systems of Power: disability</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ka029">Code: important-quote, canon-compliment</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka030')">I don't know, it just ... There may have been
                other works of fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that
                was when Korra just seemed more human.<span class="popuptext" id="ka030">Code: canon-relation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. That makes a lot-</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> Sorry.</p>

        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> Sorry.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> No, you're good.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> No, just to actually answer the question, this
            one. I think it was that ... Okay. So in the first book, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka031')">Korra gets to her lowest point. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka075')"> The implication is that she's about to jump off a cliff. But
                    we don't really get to dwell in the true feeling of that moment, the have to fix
                    it immediately because of the idea that the show may never get to come back to
                    this point, so we don't get to actually see what that means for
                    her.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka075">Systems of Power: abelism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ka031">Code: canon-critique</span></span></span> But with books three and four, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka032')">we see Korra actual deal, for more than one episode, with how
                she's effected by these things, and to me that was different.<span class="popuptext" id="ka032">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span>I don't know. It

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Continuing the idea of trauma, you
            wrote, "Asami gasped when the guard touched her, flinching away from him. It had felt so
            real. Been so real, she could even feel Korra's body beneath hers, shaking as she tried
            to wake Korra from the nightmares." Can you talk a little bit about this moment and your
            representation of Asami's trauma and how you link it to her relationship with
            Korra?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka034')">I
                think I was both going for an understanding of how Asami herself is effected by this
                really terrible thing we see happen to Korra.<span class="popuptext" id="ka034">Code: reflection</span></span></span> Because at that point, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka035')">everyone has seen someone who they think is
                all-powerful and infallible, invulnerable to an extent, be ... <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka077')">I don't want to say broken, but be injured in a

            I think it's just also the fact that Asami has watched her mother die and her father
            become this other person. And later on, although this is ... This particular story
            doesn't deal with that, though I technically was going to if I ever finished it. But I
            don't know, just her seeing people that she loves be hurt and/or die, and not be able to
            do anything, at least in her mind, anything that can alleviate what they're going
            through or prevent what is happening, especially for someone who is, or at least within
            the text was, an inventor. I don't know. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka036')">It's just <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka113')">to be someone who builds and creates

                built in subtext because <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka078')">I wasn't
                    quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> My later works are more, I guess, overt. But I
            don't know, just how Asami deals with that and the intimacy of caring for someone in
            that way, it just seemed like a really interesting juxtaposition.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, great. So for you this was sort of a
            moment where you were exploring and engaging with the slash fan community, but you
            didn't necessarily want to fully write it in yet. Is there a particular reason why you
            wanted to sort of keep it not as overt or just more hint at it?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka037')"> It has less to do with fandom
                itself and more to do with the external world. And even now it's, I guess it's ... I
                don't know. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka079')">I think it
                    just seemed like the safer option at the time. <span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka079">Systems of Power: homophobia-transphobia</span></span></span> But the more
                time I've spent in that part of fandom, the less I guess I've cared about how it's
                read or whatever it is. But at the time, it just seemed wiser, particularly if I was
                having others who may not ... Because fan works and original work for me are on the
                same level, and so I'm not concerned, I guess, with people reading it for ... people
                reading it and not seeing a difference in quality, but rather how they experience
                the content. And so I think I was still considering who the audience would
                be.<span class="popuptext" id="ka037">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, audience</span></span></span> I don't know. The shift in audience concerns came later. So I think
            writing it now, I would probably handle some things differently. And I probably will
            handle some things differently if I go back to write in that particular
            fiction.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> You should. Excellent. Thank you.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> It's on my list. <span class="inaudible">[crosstalk
                00:35:53]</span> fictions I keep promising myself I'll go.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I finished maybe four fanfictions I've ever
            written, so I understand that feeling. Big dreams. All right. Thank you. So there's one
            last quote that I wanted to talk about. You mention and you write, "For benders,
            manipulators of the elements, the old tradition had never necessarily applied, although
            there were lingering stories of past gender inequality in the water tribes. A woman
            could be as strong of a bender as a man, in fact, stronger than a man. Women ruled as
            queens without murmurs. Some had aspired to and attained the position of fire lord in
            the most traditional nation of them all. While the earth kingdom queen had a terrible
            end at the hand of Zaheer, it had certainly not been because of her gender." So I have a
            few questions about this. For you, why is there tension in tradition around gender roles
            for benders and non-benders?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka038')">I think
                it's just existing personally as a marginalized person. The way that that storyline
                was handled in LOK, I think I wasn't quite comfortable with it, just the very idea
                of the movement disappearing because of one man's end. It seems so unrealistic
                because there was a real situation with inequality there. Because we see that the
                world has adapted to cater for benders, and we don't quite know non-benders are
                faring in that world, what kind of opportunities they're having. And based on the
                conflict that the show raised, it was clear that non-benders were in a position
                where they weren't having ends meet or they weren't getting the jobs that they hoped

                    either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
                    enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
                    in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
                    world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
                    through.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka081">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ka040">Code: important-quote, canon-critique, fan-politics, critical-uptake</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. And I like too, the sort of thinking
            about the inequality between benders and non-benders, that did sort of bring in gender
            roles, which I think again is sort of a really additional and interesting layer of that.
            So you sort of answered the other questions too. I guess maybe I'll ask the last
            question then. Why is talking about these tensions important for your story?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka041')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka082')">With gender roles in particular,
                    I think it's fascinating that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all
                    these really powerful girl and women characters who were, for the most part,
                    respected, at least in later years.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka082">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span> Because when we first meet
                the Avatar world, we know that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all
                this power, she's in this position where she could eventually have the throne, she
                isn't respected by her own father.<span class="popuptext" id="ka041">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span> And there are moments in the story where
            even Katara ... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka042')">And I think I'd actually forgotten about this until
                someone else had written it in their own fanfiction, which is part of what's so fun
                about reading fanfiction. There are all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on
                right away, but someone else mentions it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the
                world and look at it from a different angle.<span class="popuptext" id="ka042">Code: important-quote, compliment, critical-uptake</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka043')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka083')">But even Katara in the beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use
                    waterbending beyond healing<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka083">Systems of Power: sexism</span></span></span>, and she goes on to become one of
                the greatest waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have
                this really powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends
                someone who is, up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more
                ruthless and so forth.<span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka084')"> So it was
                    interesting to see all these female characters get to be complex and powerful
                    and not have that held against them,<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka084">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span> unless you count Azula and
                how that ended for her.<span class="popuptext" id="ka043">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Oh, Azula. That Agni Kai is just such a good
            scene though. It still gives me the chills.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> That was just so devastating to see unfold
            because it comes back to the fact that Zuko had the kind of support that Azula never
            quite got, so he got to learn and grow past his trauma and how that had shaped him and
            warped his thinking. Whereas, for Azula ... When I was younger, I think even though I
            felt some pity for her, I didn't quite grasp just how unfair it was that she didn't have
            the opportunities to change that he did. So with age and with experience, it's just
            tragedy upon tragedy, especially when we learn later what happens with her mother. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka044')">But it was nice to see the LOK universe expand
                upon that and show us that things had changed in some ways. For one, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka085')">we have Korra, who is the avatar, and she is this
                    figure who is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity
                    that we're accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants
                    without concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think
                    about her gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering
                    herself inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this
                    particular form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin
                    and we see Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or
                    they're dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with
                    their mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well,
                    if they do have children, and so forth.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka085">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span> I don't know. It was an
                example of how that world had changed or was changing possibly for the
                better.<span class="popuptext" id="ka044">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. So we are at 45 minutes, so I don't
            want to take up too much more of your time.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> Oh, it's fine.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Are you sure?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> Oh yes.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. Okay, then I'll keep asking questions.
            I feel like I'm just learning so much from you. I just love listening to your analysis
            and your perspectives.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> I just love talking about Korra

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I know. I want to talk back too. I want to have
            a dialogue, and I'm like, "No, I have a different goal with this."</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:44:42]</span> I
            kind of came to the fandom late. I consumed fanfiction. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka045')">I wasn't part of the fandom itself, so I didn't quite
                get to be part of ... Maybe I should be happy for that because I missed all the fan
                wars.<span class="popuptext" id="ka045">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, it was brutal for a little
            while.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka046')">I
                missed the smug satisfaction, but I also missed all the stress and anger, so I'm

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I was on The Last Airbender subreddit, and it
            was very tense. There was a lot of frustration going around.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka047')">Considering my <cite>Supergirl</cite> years, I can imagine. And then when you

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Gosh no.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:45:43]</span> And
            when we turn to Asami, Asami is allowed to be a femme fatale in a way. And they changed
            their own writing where they were going to have a [inaudible 00:45:51], but they found
            these characters interesting enough to keep her on and make her part of the
            protagonist's world and important to it. So, just so many interesting happens in that
            show. I will talk about LOK and ATLA until the day that I die because it really is
            phenomenal <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:46:08]</span>.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yep. Yep. No, I 100% agree. It's like my
            favorite serious.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So, other question too. What did you learn from
            writing Marching Ants?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka048')">I
                think for that particular story I had to remind myself, especially because I had
                read so many fan fictions where this was ... And I know it's understandable, but I
                kind find it a flaw for some people. Just keeping the world in focus.<span class="popuptext" id="ka048">Code: criticism</span></span></span>
            Incorporating real aspects of that universe because it shapes how the characters are
            responding to things and what their experiences are like. And it also makes it more real
            for a reader to see those things as well, at least for me personally. So, just world
            building even on my own and also incorporating things that were already established in
            the universe. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka049')">Because there is this thing in fanfiction where we
                assume that all people who are accessing it are familiar with the text. And while
                that is often common when we want it to function beyond that world to have relevance
                in other ways, I think for me personally it's important to integrate more parts of
                the world, of the universe.<span class="popuptext" id="ka049">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, audience</span></span></span> I don't know. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka050')">For me, it was just reminding myself that, even though I'm
                writing something where there are people who are familiar with the text, it's also
                important to fill in the blanks sometimes.<span class="popuptext" id="ka050">Code: audience</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. Okay. So I want to just move to
            talking a little bit about some of the larger analysis I'm doing with the Legend of
            Korra fandom and our cover of our own. So I know you were actually able to skim the
            article I published, which was awesome, so thank you for doing that. I wanted to also
            ask you a little bit, if you could talk through your own sort of interpretations and
            experiences with results. SO I know that you didn't start participating in the Korra
            fandom until after the series was finish, but part of my analysis is looking at how the
            fandom really shifted, especially as the characters really began developing and as the
            writers really changed their original intentions, like you were saying, with Asami being
            femme fatale and then with Asami and Korra's relationship, and how that development in
            the show really shaped the fan community. In doing an analysis of the most common
            relationships across from before Korra and Asami became canon or even subtextual, and
            then around the time ... around the end of book three when Korra and Asami's
            relationship starts to sort of seem to turn and make a turn towards one of romance, and
            then finally at the end when their romance is confirmed. So that's sort of the three
            different points I'm looking at. So, before there's any kind of subtextual relationship,
            the most popular relationships were Korra and Mako, Korra and Asami, and Bolin and
            Korra. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, why do you think people
            were so originally drawn to Korra and Mako at first and Korra and Bolin?</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka051')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka088')">I think,
                    and I'll probably go with my own fandom experiences, it just comes back to how
                    the world is constructed externally. So just even the idea of imagining inside
                    of what was placed before us, it takes a special kind of familiarity with the
                    boarders of the world to imagine a world that is different from what is
                    presented to you.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka088">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka089')"> At the time, I don't know, it was just that Korra
                    and Mako were what was the norm. And so I think it made sense for some people to
                    only be able to see that happening. I mean, I didn't see the possibility of
                    Korrasami until the very end.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka089">Systems of Power: heteronormativity</span></span></span> But when I circled back around

            [crosstalk 00:51:24]</p>

        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka052')">But yeah, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka090')">I just, spending so much time reading so much fanfiction

                    from <cite>Steven Universe</cite> into <cite>Supergirl</cite>, there was
                    just more of an interaction with another side of fandom, the slash side of
                    fandom. I don't know. I think you have to be integrated with others who are
                    looking for more than what's presented, looking for more than what's norm,
                    what's the acceptable way of telling a story of any kind of relationship really.

                    find that when those characters are black or just generally a person of color in
                    comparison to a character being white, that people are least particular when the
                    fandom's dominated by white faces and so forth. They are more likely to explore
                    those characters and to humanize them and to want to get to know them better,
                    while other characters and what their hopes and dreams and ideas might be for

            I didn't really see the shift until, I think, the third book when they were going
            through the journey of just how the Earth Kingdom is changing and they have them
            training together, and so <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:54:39]</span> Korra and the
            family training together. Then I began to see the inkling of what they might be going
            towards. I was like, "Ah, there it is." And then finally when we are at that moment
            where Asami's telling Korra that, whatever she needs, that she's there for her
            basically. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka055')">When I saw that <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka096')">I was like, "Okay. This is pretty blatant. I

                because when you go back and you see the way that Korra and Asami speak to each
                other in the beginning, it's there, but it's not intentional subtext. It's like ...
                I mean, it makes sense that some people didn't see it.<span class="popuptext" id="ka055">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. Even in the season four finale, there was
            still people who were insistent that their relationship was still a friendship. And I'm
            like, "They're holding hands walking off into the sunset."</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> When that happened I was like, especially as
            someone who had seen other animated shows and so was familiar with the trope of the
            heroes walking off into the sunset together or holding hands with each other, that
            particular ending, it just seemed to imply so much. After I had finished watching the
            show, I went down to see one of my cousins, who's younger than me but he's also spent a
            lot of time watching anime and animated shows and so forth, and I just brought it up in
            passing casually to see what he would say. He was like, "I can't believe they did X, Y,
            Z." And I was like, "So you see it too," which means that it's pretty much right there
            for anyone who is actually paying attention and familiar with visual cues in
            storytelling. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka056')">Actually, I think it may have come back to that as well, a combination of both
                familiarity with visual cues in storytelling, both a tendency to read closer in text
                in general, whether it's literature or visual media, as well as having familiarized
                yourself with another community. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka097')">I'm always on the fence sometimes when I'm talking
                    about how people are seeing or not seeing certain things. Because even with my
                    current fandom, it's like half the people are saying that we're delusional or
                    creating things where there aren't things. And then other times you see these
                    exact phenomena occurring in cishet media.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka097">Systems of Power: heteronormativity</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="ka056">Code: important-quote, fan-politics</span></span></span> So, it's like
            it's there. They know what they're doing. They're just trying to decide if it's worth
            it.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Is that with Kara and Lena. I've only watched
            up to season three of <cite>Supergirl</cite>, so I've heard some rumblings, but I
            haven't-</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka057')">At
                that time ... When I first came across it, I was like, "They're probably
                overreacting," because I know how fandom can get.<span class="popuptext" id="ka057">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yup.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> So I came as a skeptic actually. And then I sat
            down. After getting through the first season, I sat down into the second season. And
            then there's this moment where ... And no offense to Katie, but her character is ... She
            tries, but I think somehow never seem to be cishet. There's this moment where she's
            speaking to ... She's inviting her to this major event, and she takes a moment for a
            real long, hyper-focused upon lip bite. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka058')">And I'm
                like, "In what world am I supposed to view this as platonic? <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka098')">I mean, I know I was raised
                    in a pretty fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing
                    here things that I should not be seeing between two <span class="inaudible">[inaudible

                believer. And the longer I watched the show, the more it seemed to grow.<span class="popuptext" id="ka058">Code: canon-relation</span></span></span> And
            you could tell where it shifted from this being accidental to the actors leaning into it
            because they respected the audience, and they were having fun with it. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka059')">And
                you could tell, from a fandom perspective, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka099')">some people who are cishet won't be able to speak to
                    this<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka099">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span>, but you could tell that the writer's room was split in
                how they were portraying the characters because <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka100')">I think they got uncomfortable with how fandom
                    was growing so rapidly and intensely around these two
                    characters<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka100">Systems of Power: homophobia-transphobia</span></span></span>, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka101')">even
                    to the point where they used the black character as a wedge between
                    them<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka101">Systems of Power: racism</span></span></span>. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
                in that show. <span class="popuptext" id="ka059">Code: important-quote, canon-critique, fan-politics</span></span></span>But now in seasons four a five, they have really leaned into
            it, including parallels with canon couples. So it feels like they're heading there, but
            you never know with these people. You never know with these people.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> It could be some major queerbaiting, so we'll
            see.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> At this point, they may go down as the greatest
            baiters in history. </p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Oh my gosh.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> And sorry if I'm taking up your time-</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> No, no.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> It's been ... I'm at the point where I've had to
            distance myself because it's just gotten so frustrating and so intense, and you get so
            much anger with the way it was being handled. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka060')">But we basically had these <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka102')">two
                    actors leaning into it because they didn't have a problem with
                    it<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka102">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span>, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka103')">but we see that some of the writers were
                    uncomfortable, or I guess maybe the network or the showrunners were
                    uncomfortable where the story was heading.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="ka103">Systems of Power: homophobia-transphobia</span></span></span> And so they moved
                away from what was organically developing to the extent where they took two
                characters who never said more than a single word to each other, and one of these
                characters actively disliked the other character, and said, "Hey, we're going to
                have these two put together. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka104')">And we are

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Oh. Oh, okay.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> Yeah.<span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka061')"> So
                when you start off with a show that has ... <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka105')">It's basically girl-next-door, blonde, blue-eyed, sort of

                <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'ka107')">And then you break them apart in the

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> All right. I do have to run because I have a
            meeting at 3:15, but I want to thank you so, so much for taking the time to do this.
            It's been so wonderful hearing your perspective and hearing about your relationship with
            The Marching Ants and <cite>The Legend of Korra</cite> as well as <cite>Avatar: The
                Last Airbender</cite> and <cite>Supergirl</cite>. Thank you so much for talking
            to me and taking time to do this.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> Yeah, I'm always happy to do stuff like this, so
            I'm really happy to have been able to help.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> And please update me.</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> I will get on my soapbox always for anything to
            do with the Avatar world and for fandom in general.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> It's like a running joke in my department ...
            I've been here for four years now, and it's like the running joke that I'm the Korra
            girl. Everywhere I go I'm like, "Have you guys seen <cite>The Legend of Korra</cite>?"
            And everyone's like, "We get it. You like <cite>The Legend of
            Korra</cite>."</p>
        <p><strong>kittya:</strong> Yeah, my friends feel the same way about me and
                <cite>Supergirl</cite> now. So, I'm sorry, but I just can't help
            myself.</p>
