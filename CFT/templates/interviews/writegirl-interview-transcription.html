        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Okay, today on January 19th, 2020, I am
            interviewing WriteGirl. Would you like to introduce yourself?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Hi, my nom de plume I guess is WriteGirl. I'm
            a fanfiction writer, and I write in a couple different fandoms. That's about it.
            Anything else?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Are you consenting to being audio
            recorded?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yes I am.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Beautiful. Thank you. All right, we'll just
            kind of dive right in. I'm going to ask you first a few questions about yourself as a
            fanfiction writer, and your development over the years, and the fandoms you
            participate, and all that.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Okay.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> First, can you tell me a little bit about
            yourself as a fanfiction writer? When and how did you start writing fanfiction? Which
            fandoms did you start with? How did your participation in fan communities change over
            the years, and what fandoms do you currently participate in, and why? If that's a lot of
            questions, I can also go back and reiterate some of them.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> When and how did I start writing fanfiction?
            I actually discovered fanfiction in high school, way back when when I was a senior,
            just randomly on the internet. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg01')">And I actually really liked a
                show called <cite>Xena: Warrior Princess</cite>. That was kind of my very first fandom. I really
                liked, see I can't even remember now, Ares and Gabrielle. I wrote a fanfiction
                about them that was set in modern times. That was my very first fan
            fic.<span class="popuptext" id="wg01">Code: modern-setting</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. And just so you know, I'm probably not
            going to talk as much while you're talking. And I'll try also to refrain from laughing,
            because I have a very loud laugh. So, in case you're like, "What is she doing right
            now?" And I'm like... That's just me silently laughing.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Okay.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Okay. Great. How has your participation in the
            fan communities changed over the years then since your high school days?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> It's certainly gotten more active. I think I
            wrote that one fanfiction when I was in senior year in high school, and then I didn't
            write anything else until I was a junior in college. But during that time, I was mostly
            reading, and kind of just, what was it? Fanfiction.net. I discovered that, and kind of
            dived in, and didn't peek my head up for three years. And then, I got into which fandom?
            It's so long ago now. Brain? Yes, think back 20 years. I can't remember which fandom.
            But then I wrote another piece of fanfiction and posted it on fanfiction.net. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg02')">And then that's when I kind of got feedback, because the
                first fanfic, I never got any feedback from anyone. I was just like, "Oh, I'm
                shouting into the dark." So yeah, it kind of changed, and it got me a bit more
                active, and like, people actually want to say something about it. What did you think
                about it? I started getting a bit more communication, a bit more activity.<span class="popuptext" id="wg02">Code: reception</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg03')">And then people would be like, "Oh, your fanfic is
                this like this one, so why don't you go read this fanfic?" It kind of was a jumping
                off point for me.<span class="popuptext" id="wg03">Code: fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span> And currently, I just kind of write like a little hermit,
            and respond to people who write reviews. And that's about it. My interaction with fandom
            is kind of limited, I guess.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> That's great. That's very similar to my own
            story. I had started writing fanfiction 15 years ago on fanfiction.net.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yeah, it's a gateway drug.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, it is. Do you want to tell me, if you
            remember, a little bit about that first bit of feedback you got that sort of inspired
            you to keep writing?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yes.It was very short
            and sweet. X-Men. That was the fandom.  <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg04')">X-Men comics. And I wrote a story, once
                again, set in modern times. I kind of do this a lot. I take characters out of their
                setting and transpose them into reality.<span class="popuptext" id="wg04">Code: modern-setting</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg05')">And someone wrote a really detailed review, just about
                how, I remember they said they could taste the road dust from my writing. And I was
                like, wow. I never thought of it that way. That's really cool. That kind of inspired
                me to write more, that I could get that emotion out of somebody. They felt like they
                were actually there with them.<span class="popuptext" id="wg05">Code: important-quote, reception</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> That's great. Also, that's a very well-written
            review.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yes, I was rather shocked.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Do you want to tell me a little bit about texts
            that you've been producing recently, and stuff that you've been writing
            recently?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Sure. I really got into <cite>Game of Thrones</cite>. I've
            been watching it since the first season. The first episode, I watched it, and then went
            out and bought all of the books that were available, because I'm that kind of nerd, and
            read them all over a week. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg06')">I knew everything that was going to
                happen until about Season Four. And was perfectly happy with it, really wasn't
                paying any attention.<span class="popuptext" id="wg06">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span> I kind of dropped out of fanfiction. I'd been writing
            before that in the Marvel universe, and I was kind of heavy in that one, and then just
            kind of stopped. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg07')">So, right when about Season
                Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
                Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
                no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
                brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
                thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
                wrote a <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
                series, the first one.<span class="popuptext" id="wg07">Code: important-quote, canon-critique, canon-resistant, motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Awesome. Thank you. That's a really nice
            segue into talking about the actual fanfiction that I was looking at. Actually, your
            fanfiction, before I chose to do my dissertation on <cite>Game of Thrones</cite>, I was reading your
            fanfiction, and I was like, "I want to actually add <cite>Game of Thrones</cite>, because I need to
            deal with Missandei's death, and all the terribleness."</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yes.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Do you want to talk a little bit about your
            motivation writing your fic? I know you sort of have a series of drabbles, a series of
            fix-it fics, of going back through particular moments and re-imagining them. But can you
            talk a little bit about that motivation, and why you chose fix-it fics in
            particular?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg08')">I don't
                know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite <cite>Doctor Who</cite> episodes is Turn Left. And
                it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
                What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
                And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
                and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
                the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
                that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
                world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
                would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
                maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
                how I got into that.<span class="popuptext" id="wg08">Code: important-quote, canon-resistant, fix-it, motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. I also wanted to ask too, your fic is a
            series of drabbles, and so you chose to write these on the shorter side. Do you want to
            explain a little bit why you chose shorter versions instead of exploring these different
            stories in more length?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg09')">Because I'm
                a length whore. That's the problem. I get into these fics, and I have these ideas,
                and then they expand out of control, and then I get into a story that's suddenly 30
                chapters long, and then I run out of steam. I'm one of those authors who does kind
                of get bored, and then starts cheating on my fic, which is happening right now in
                <cite>Game of Thrones</cite>.<span class="popuptext" id="wg09">Code: reflection</span></span></span> I'm trying to be good. <cite>The Witcher</cite> has kind of caught me. So
            I'm just like, no, I can't do that. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg10')">Let me just zero in on
                the one moment that I think is pivotal, and just kind of get that out, and then
                leave it alone. Because a lot of my drabbles, they are parts of much bigger fics. I
                just haven't posted them.<span class="popuptext" id="wg10">Code: vignette</span></span></span> Because I think there is one, especially the one
            with Ned Stark, and it's a whole thing with when he's speaking to Cersei. I changed it
            so that he told Robert beforehand. Robert already knows what's going on. I was just
            letting you know as a courtesy so you could get out of dodge before he murders you and
            your children. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg11')">That I've actually
                written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
                okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
                alone.<span class="popuptext" id="wg11">Code: canon-resistant, vignette, drafting</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> That's so fascinating. So you have a 200-page
            fic... So where is that living right now? Is it published anywhere, or is it just on
            your computer?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> It's living on my computer right now. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg12')">It's not done. It's not a solid 200 pages. I'm a very
                chaotic writer, so I will get a bit of dialog in my head. I will see something, and
                I will kind of write around that, and build around that, and string a bunch of
                scenes. It's 200 pages, but it's 200 pages of broken up paragraphs, bits of dialog,
                bits of scenery. So if I ever fleshed it out, it would be much longer, because I
                have a problem containing myself.<span class="popuptext" id="wg12">Code: drafting</span></span></span> But yeah, it's a lot. Going into succession
            laws, and all those types of things, and who's going to inherit what, and how the world
            would unspool, because it's still going to happen. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg13')">But all of a suddenly, this particular set of characters is no longer in the
                picture. So how does that affect everything else? How does Daenerys Targaryen deal
                with a kingdom that is pretty much united with a war hero still on the throne?<span class="popuptext" id="wg13">Code: canon-resistant</span></span></span> So,
                yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So you're just like, "I'm just going to rewrite
            everything, or start from scratch." Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yes.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> That's amazing. I hope that you finish that at
            one point, because that is an incredible amount of work and writing. I'm sure it mirrors
            the writing in your fic. You're a wonderful writer, so I would love to read
            that.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg14')">I've had a
                couple requests from the other ones. They're like, "I would love to read this
                story." I'm like, "No, you don't understand. It's a lot to wade
            through."<span class="popuptext" id="wg14">Code: reception</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Okay, awesome. What do you think are some of
            the strengths of your collection of drabbles?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> I just think some people want to see something
            from a different point of view. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg15')">I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
                I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
                outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
                really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
                to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.<span class="popuptext" id="wg15">Code: canon-compliant, reflection audience</span></span></span> I don't know
            what else. I'm bad at listing strengths.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> It's fine. It's great. And so, what about some
            challenges then that you've found writing this one?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Finding voice. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg16')">I have a very hard time
                getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
                motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
                are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
                that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
                top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges.<span class="popuptext" id="wg16">Code: canon-compliant, reflection</span></span></span> Writing voice is another
            one. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg17')">Because one thing as a writer that will pull me completely out of a story is if
            there is a colloquialism that should not belong. Or if
                you're using words, and I'm like, okay, I've never heard that word used on the show,
                so now you've just dropped a bomb in the middle of a wedding cake, and there's cake
                everywhere. It just pulls me out.<span class="popuptext" id="wg17">Code: fan-politics, canon-compliant</span></span></span> Things like that. Because I know what I
            want to say, but how do I get this character to say it?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> You're very focused on keeping true to the
            universe then, and keeping true to the show, even though you're thinking about different
            direction that it might go in?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yes.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. I also wanted to ask why you decided
            to focus on some characters. I particularly want to talk about the chapters on Missandei
            and Sansa. Why did you choose to focus on them? And if you want to talk about any of the
            other characters you decide to focus on.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg18')">I chose Sansa in particular, and I
                think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
                little bit of character assassination.<span class="popuptext" id="wg18">Code: canon-critique, canon-resistant, motivation</span></span></span> In that season, you see Sansa being in
            the veil. And I did read some of George RR Martin's clips from Winds of Winter that he's
            posted, which hopefully he will bring out soon. And you see a Sansa who's in the veil,
            who's kind of learning game from Petyr. She's learning from a master how to be
            manipulative in everything.<span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg86')"> So seeing that, and kind of juxtaposing it against the Sansa
            we were getting in the show was a little irksome.<span class="popuptext" id="wg86">Code: canon-critique</span></span></span> She was just somebody who was
            following along. She didn't seem to have a plan. She didn't seem to be herself. She
            became kind of a ghost of herself in the later seasons, until the last season, and they
            completely ruined her character. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg19')">I wanted to kind of show a Sansa who was still herself.
                A Sansa who was <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg65')">willing to not listen to him, who
                    understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
                    manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
                    only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
                    run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
                    ends are."<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg65">Systems of Power: other feminism</span></span></span> That's kind of where that idea came from.<span class="popuptext" id="wg19">Code: canon-resistant, motivation</span></span></span> And
            she wasn't originally supposed to... The wolves weren't supposed to be there in the
            original script. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg20')">She was
                supposed to kind of get lost in the trees, and they were supposed to find her. But I
                thought that was a little bit ignominious for her. So then I remembered, Oh,
                Nimeria's wolf pack. I was like, they haven't used that in the show at all, so why
                not?<span class="popuptext" id="wg20">Code: canon-resistant, reflection</span></span></span> She's riding from the veil, through the riverlands north. You would
            think Nimeria 00:15:30 kind of would, because this is my human sister. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg21')">There's actually a lot more of that fic that is written
                that didn't make it in. A whole thing where you get it from Nimeria's point of view
                where you can see her. She's like, okay, just following to see what's going to
                happen. And then when Sansa decides to run, that's when she decides to attack. But I
                thought that was a bit superfluous, so I took all of that out.<span class="popuptext" id="wg21">Code: revising</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. And then what about Missandei? After
            Missandei's demise?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg22')">I literally got up off the couch and walked away when
            she got beheaded. I was very upset. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg66')">It pissed me
                    off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
                    slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
                    did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
                    white women.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg66">Systems of Power: racism</span></span></span> That was very, very frustrating and irritating to

            people. She wouldn't tell Daenerys to...It seemed like she was giving her the go ahead
            to just burn King's Landing to the ground at this point. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg87')">That seemed completely out of
            character for me. The whole scene was out of character for me.<span class="popuptext" id="wg87">Code: canon-critique</span></span></span> Just historically
            speaking, if you had a hostage that was that valuable, you're not going to behead her on
            the walls of your city. Because if there's something that's going to keep you from
            attacking, it is letting someone know, "Hey, I have your person." I was just like, that
            whole scene makes absolutely no sense. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg23')">So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
                of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
                That was kind of the motivation for that.<span class="popuptext" id="wg23">Code: canon-critique, critical-uptake, motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. I'm going to actually
            probably ask a little bit about this in later texts, but I'm really interested in how
            Missandei has been taken up especially after her death, and also sort of the lack of the
            ways that she's been taken up. And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about if
            you noticed that in the fanfic community, and what you've sort of observed with how
            people are talking about Missandei.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg24')">Yes. [Missandei's] a weird character. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg88')">Mostly she seems to almost
                be absent from things. She's window dressing. She's there, she doesn't speak, or she
                speaks, it's one or two sentences in the entire fic.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg88">Systems of Power: racism</span></span></span> And it's frustrating because
                once again in the book, she's such a pivotal character.<span class="popuptext" id="wg24">Code: important-quote, fan-politics</span></span></span> One of my favorite
            scenes with her is when she is negotiating when Daenerys is away, and Varys is looking
            at her like, "This little girl is Petyr Baelish and Varys combined." She's that smart,
            she's that devious. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg25')">And so, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg89')">you get those fics where she
                either has none of those, she's either not there, or she has really none of those
                attributes. She's kind of just a yes person. Yes, Khaleesi, no Khaleesi, yes my

            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg26')">That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
                delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.

                    away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the

                of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg68')">I don't know if I was a former slave. The one thing I

                    into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
                    anymore.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg68">Systems of Power: antiracism</span></span></span> And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
                like to see a bit more of that in <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> fanfiction. She's really an
                underused character.<span class="popuptext" id="wg26">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, critical-uptake fan-practices-uptake, motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Awesome, thank you. So, next question.
            About the tags that you used. One of the ways that I have been working with the texts is
            by looking at the additional tags that are being used, which is how I found your fic,
            because I think you have the one that, "Missandei deserved better." It popped out at me
            on my radar, and I was like, "I need to read this." I don't know if you have the list of
            the tags that you used in front of you, but I was wondering if you could talk through
            what some of these tags mean to you, and how you intended to reach your audience with
            these tags, and how else you might have tagged your text, or continue to tag
            it?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Okay. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg27')">One
                thing I noticed about the <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> fandom, because I did just kind of jump
                in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
                and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
                unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let me
                try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
                There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
                improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.<span class="popuptext" id="wg27">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake, audience</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg28')">The
                "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
                People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
                right there." So I had the "What if."<span class="popuptext" id="wg28">Code: fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake, fix-it, reception</span></span></span> Other addition tags to be added, just
            to let people know that these may change at any given time. So this is never set in
            stone. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg29')">Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...

                of them may be Gen, some of them, I haven't written one yet, but some of them may be
                adult in the future. Some of them may have a lot of violence in them, so just be
                aware. Don't ever come back to this fic and think, "This is what it is." Because

            She was the one character that I think really translated very well. "You win or you
            die." Famous saying from the show. Olenna always wins, because she does. Even when she
            dies, especially when she dies, which is a reference to the fic where Cersei realizes
            that the gold that she thought she was getting from Highgarden isn't gold all the way.

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, exactly. Also, I 100% agree that
            Missandei and Grey Worm are the best pairing. They are my favorite ship in the show, and
            they also had the best romance, and the best romantic scene. Okay.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yeah. We're here.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So mad. Thank you for going through that. All
            right, now I'm going to ask some questions about the specific moments in your text. And
            I'm going to start with Chapter Five, the Sansa text, in which Sansa gets unexpected
            help. First, you talked a little bit about this before, but if you want to add anything
            to this, why did you choose to have Sansa run away and escape?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg38')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg69')">I wanted her to have a little bit more
                    agency.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg69">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span> It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
                dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
                that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
                Sansa. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg92')">And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
                we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
                that was a little irritating to me.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg92">Systems of Power: sexism</span></span></span>  <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg70')">So I wanted
                    her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
                    supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
                    that.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg70">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="wg38">Code: important-quote, canon-critique, critical-uptake, fix-it, motivation</span></span></span> Like, these are the people who betrayed my
            brother, who got my brother and my mother killed, who got our soldiers killed, who
            betrayed the north, and you want me to go and marry this person? <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg39')">I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
                beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
                thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?<span class="popuptext" id="wg39">Code: canon-critique, critical-uptake, motivation</span></span></span> Book Sansa would
            try to use it to her advantage as well as she could, which is, try to get as far north
            as I could, and then try to get to people who would help me. I can't use you anymore,
            and I'm not going to let you use me. So, her whole thing was, let me get as far north as
            I can, and then see where I can go and get away from these people. She's looking at the
            land, she knows she's in the <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:27:33]</span>. The horses are
            going to be kind of useless, at least that's what she thought. Like, I can run. I'm
            light, I'm quick on my feet, these are southern knights, if you will, heavy on
            horseback, and heavy armor. I can get away from them. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg93')">And like she says in the fic even
            if I get bit by a lizard-lion or I starve, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg94')">that's my choice. But it won't be going back

            whole other kettle of fish, in the <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> universe and in reality. So that's
            kind of why I had her run.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. There are a few moments from
            Sansa's point of view of Petyr, and the future she sort of has in the show. I'm just
            going to read some of the quotes from your text, and ask you to sort of explain each
            one. The first is, "Petyr would never let her go, and she had no desire for Brienne and
            and Pod to die, so she feigned anger and disdain."</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Okay. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg40')">That was my take on the scene where Brienne and Pod meet her in the tavern, where
                she seems to be at first a little surprised, a little relieved, and then you kind of
                see her shut down a bit.<span class="popuptext" id="wg40">Code: implicit-explicit</span></span></span> She kind of sits back, her eyes go
                <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:29:05]</span> She kind of tucks her chin. Where she's
            like, "Okay, I don't want this." <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg41')">But in my mind, I
                didn't think she didn't want it because she didn't necessarily trust Brienne, it was
                more because Petyr would never let her go. Even if this person said, "I'm going to
                help you," <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg71')">he would never allow that, because he
                    wants control of her, and that is something that she realizes, because she's not
                    an idiot.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg71">Systems of Power: other feminism</span></span></span> She's seen this man in King's Landing, she sees how
                he operates. She sees how he operates in the Eyrie. If he doesn't have total control
                of her, he's not going to allow it. And the best way to do that would be to get rid
                of these two people. And she doesn't want anyone to die for her. So that was kind of
                my read on that situation.<span class="popuptext" id="wg41">Code: implicit-explicit</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. So the next quote I have is, "The
            flickering torchlight made Peytr's features even sharper, and cast red shadows on his
            pale skin, turning him into a demon come to steal her soul." Can you talk a little bit
            more about this moment?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> This is more, she's really realizing,
            everything is stripped away. She's afraid, she's in the mud, and she's seeing things
            very clearly. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg99')">There's a poem that I really like. I can't remember the name of it now,

            realizing this man is really evil. And the torchlight just kind of emphasizes that. He's
            almost in her eyes at this point inhuman, in my mind. It's kind of like you kind of made
            a deal with the devil, and he looked very nice, and now you're seeing him for what he
            is. She's really afraid, like, I can't get away, he's going to take everything,
            including my soul. It's not just my body that he's after.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. And then the last one, which
            I think you have talked a little bit about. But just the quote that, "She would not
            marry Ramsay Bolton, not to save her own life, not for Winterfell, and not for Petyr's
            schemes." Can you talk a little bit about that quote?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yeah. This was just a reference to Sansa's
            pride. Since she is a Stark, if you want to go back, they never really talk about in the
            show, but the Boltons were the Red Kings who the Starks kind of stamped out and made
            them vassal lords. So it's one, against my blood, we're not going to give this to you.
            The Boltons will never integrate with the Starks. And it's more just, I'm not going to
            do this. I can't marry this person. I can't marry the son of the man who murdered my
            brother, my brother's wife, his unborn child, who did all of this. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg42')">It doesn't matter if it's to save my life. Even if you

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great, thank you. And then my last question is,
            you mentioned quite a few times Sansa's relationship with stories and tales of the
            damsel in distress, and the knight. The things that she sort of grew up hearing. You
            brought that up quite a bit in your fic, and I was wondering if you could talk about
            that. Specifically you had the quote, "They brought into mind old Nan's stories of girls
            losing their way in the woods and being devoured. Now they filled her with a sense of
            purpose, of power." Can you talk a little bit about Sansa's relationship with
            stories?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yeah. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg43')">Sansa is really presented as one of those girls with her
            head in the clouds. She's definitely not a Margaery Tyrell. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg74')">She was definitely never really prepared for court
                    life.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg74">Systems of Power: class</span></span></span> She has a view of it that is heavily skewed by stories of
            <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:33:28]</span> of these <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg75')">wonderful knights in their shining armor, these
                    lovely ladies who are just ethereal in their beauty, everything being wrapped up
                    in a bow, happily ever after. Maybe something happens, but someone's always
                    rescued.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg75">Systems of Power: heteronormativity</span></span></span> And through the series, that kind of gets torn away
                from her bit by bit. The Prince Charming that she thought was a Prince Charming is
                definitely not. There's no one comes to save her. Her brother's more interested in
                being a king than coming to rescue her from the tower, and the monsters inside it.
            <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg76')">So really, Sansa's really forced to grow up,
                    and she's really forced to see all these stories as exactly what they are.
                    They're just stories.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg76">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span> They're empty stories to make children
                happy. So when she's thinking back on this, she's thinking more of the scarier
                stories that maybe she didn't want to listen to.<span class="popuptext" id="wg43">Code: important-quote, reflection</span></span></span> Like Bran says he loves the
            scary stories. It's maybe like a Little Red Riding Hood version of Westeros where yes,
            she gets lost. Little Red Riding Hood gets lost in the woods, and does she get saved?
            No, she gets devoured by wolves. But these wolves aren't the wolves in the story. These
            wolves are there to help her. She's remembering, she's listened to the howling from the
            wolves when she was a child, and all these scary stories that scared her, and now she's
            kind of in that situation realizing it's not scary. What I should have been afraid of, I
            don't have to be afraid of. I'm saying this wrong. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg44')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg77')">What I was afraid of, I should never have
                    been afraid of, what I wanted was the thing I should have been worried about.
                    She's really kind of flipped the script in her own mind.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg77">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span> And
                she's standing amongst these wolves, and it's like before, she would have been
                terrified. She would have been cowering. And now she realizes, this is where I need
                to be. This is where it's at.<span class="popuptext" id="wg44">Code: reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. All right. I want to move on
            and talk about Chapter 10. Again, you talked a little bit about this, but if you have
            anything else to add, why did you decide to write about Missandei's final moments, and
            her life? And then, having her throw Cersei off the ledge with herself?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Missandei has always been an interesting
            character to me. She's extraordinarily intelligent, she comes from a place that we never
            really get to see in the <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> universe, and we never really get a lot of
            background about her character. They only mentioned two times her being from the Isle of
            Naath, and we don't really know what that is. Hold on for one second. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg45')">So yeah, [Missandei]'s such an interesting character. There's
                so much about her that could be written that isn't written. I just kind of wanted to
                investigate a little bit. What would life have been like for this character?<span class="popuptext" id="wg45">Code: implicit-explicit</span></span></span>
            Even in the books when we see her, she never really muses on where she came from. She's
            more interested in what is happening right now, and where are we going forward. To me,
            it's always interesting at the end of your life, you should always have a bit of where I
            came from. She's just thinking about things she regrets, like here I am in this place,
            all the things that I've seen, all the things that I've done. I don't remember what the
            beaches look like in my home. I don't remember my parents. I don't remember what the
            water felt like on my skin. So it's like I have all these new memories, maybe for the
            worse, some for the better, but the things that she really cherished, she doesn't
            have.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. There is a quote I wanted to ask you
            about too. You have the quote, "They were risks Missandei would face gladly if it meant
            freeing others from bondage, and allowing them the chance to finally live." Can you talk
            a little bit about that moment?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yeah, this is a moment where Missandei, she's
            reviewing over her life, she's thinking of everything she's done. I imagine as a slave
            in Astapor especially with the walk of punishment, and things like that, taking risks
            was not something she would have ever done, just for simple fear of being up on one of
            those crosses, fear of being beaten, fear of being abused. But since being free, it's
            all been a risk. Everything that she's done, whether it's following Daenerys, choosing
            to stay with her knowing that she's going into battle. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg46')">These were all things she's done because she believes in
                Daenerys' vision, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg78')">she believes in a world
                    without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
                    something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
                    times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
                    I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
                    to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
                    think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
                    sentiment.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg78">Systems of Power: antiracism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="wg46">Code: important-quote, critical-uptake, reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit
            about Missandei's decision to grab and speak to Cersei too. So, you wrote, "She knew
            eyes like that," referring to Cersei's eyes. "They were the eyes who cared for nothing
            but themselves and their own pleasure, the eyes of those who ordered children torn from
            their mothers' breasts for the meager coin it would give them. They watched as slaves
            fought each other to the death for their amusement, and bred others like cattle. They
            expected her to beg, to plead for her life." Can you talk about her interpretation there
            of Cersei?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg47')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg79')">She's really
                    seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
                    woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
                    anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
                    back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
                    Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
                    slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
                    she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
                    jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
                    great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
                    I've seen it before.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg79">Systems of Power: class racism other</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="wg47">Code: important-quote, critical-uptake, reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. And then, when Cersei addresses
            Missandei, she speaks to her, and she smiles. She says, "Her smile caught the Lion Queen
            offguard." And she says, "'You would have fit in well with the masters in Astapor,' she
            said, calm as the waters off Naath, as her hand latched on to the woman's wrist." Can
            you talk a little bit about this moment?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yeah. This was a moment where Missandei, she
            realizes maybe without a doubt, that I'm going to die. I was brought up here for a
            reason, and it wasn't just to say, "Hi, we have her," and then take me down. And she
            realizes that, she recognizes it, and it's kind of the culmination of everything that
            she knows. When Daenerys first got her, she told her, "We will be marching to our
            deaths, possibly. You don't know." And it's kind of
                like, out of all the close calls, out of everything we've done, this is this moment,
                and it's not a smile of hubris, or a smile of, okay, this is it. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg48')">It's a smile of, I
                can't think of the word, but being resigned to my fate. And if this is it, then this
                is it. And like I say, she recognizes in Cersei the same evil that she saw in
                Astapor where she's kind of like, "<span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg80')">No, you
                    would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
                    think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
                    better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
                    are not. You are exactly like them<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg80">Systems of Power: class racism</span></span></span>." And in the end, she kind
                of wants to let her know. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg102')">It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
                that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg102">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span> I see exactly what
                you are.<span class="popuptext" id="wg48">Code: critical-uptake, reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. And then finally, a sort of short quote
            that I think you've actually talked about quite a bit, and seems to be a theme both in
            this chapter as well as the Sansa chapter. But you have just the quote, "No one will
            ever use me again."</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yeah. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg49')">Like I
                said, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg103')">as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
                be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
                be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg103">Systems of Power: antiracism other</span></span></span> Kind of like, I hate to use the
                comparison, but if you ever get out of a really bad relationship, and you're just
                like, "No, never again. I know the signs. I will never let that happen to me again."
            <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg81')">And for her of course it's more extreme,
                    from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
                    decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
                    getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
                    found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
                    myself.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg81">Systems of Power: antiracism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="wg49">Code: critical-uptake, reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Excellent, thank you. Okay. My last
            question about your fanfic is, what did you learn as you've been writing
            this?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> I've learned that writing <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> is
            very hard. It is. It's a lot to absorb, and then spew back out. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg50')">I've learned a lot about people actually in the fandom.
                <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> has a very active fandom. I wasn't prepared for that when I joined.
                You get people who, there are the butts, there are the trolls. Trolls are going to
                troll though, so I just kind of push them to the side.<span class="popuptext" id="wg50">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg51')">But there are people who
                they're really willing to engage with you, and they have questions. In a lot of
                other fandoms, some people are just like, "This is a nice story." <cite>Game of Thrones</cite>
                fans will have questions for you in the comments. They'll be like, "What about this?
                And what about this? Oh, what about this? What do you think about this?" It's fun to
                get that dialog. That's something I never had before.<span class="popuptext" id="wg51">Code: fan-politics, reception</span></span></span>

                research on some of the fic, for things like trauma, and how people respond to
                trauma. Especially in the case of Sansa and Missandei, how do people overcome
                certain difficulties after being in these different positions?<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg103">Systems of Power: other disability</span></span></span> That was a little bit
                interesting. I did a little bit of in-depth on that, because once again, I'm that

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I have two questions from that, just followup
            questions. First, so you said that there are trolls, and trolls will troll, of course.
            What kind of trolls have you seen? Have they commented on your piece, or you just see
            them floating around the fandom? What do they do?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg54')">I actually
                had one troll who just wrote, "Fuck you, you bastard." And I was like, yes. I was
                just like, "Whoa. Okay. I'm sorry you're having such a bad day. Go have a mimosa.
                Just don't take it out on me."<span class="popuptext" id="wg54">Code: reception</span></span></span> I have no problem with constructive criticism.
            I love constructive criticism, because that's how you grow as a writer. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg55')">But
                there are just people who are just nasty. In all the fandoms I've been in, it
                thankfully hasn't happened to me yet, and I've actually had people defend me in
                comments. They're just like, "Get that shit out of here." I'm like, "Okay, thank you
                for being nice." But it seems the <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> fandoms can get real violent. They
                get real virulent with their hatred in the comments section. I can't muster that
                kind of hatred. If I don't like something, I just click off of it. I don't get the
                hate.<span class="popuptext" id="wg55">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, reception</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I don't either, but I can absolutely imagine
            it. You also mentioned you did research, and you did research on trauma and ways that
            people recover, or live with trauma. Can you talk a bit about what that research looked
            like?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg56')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg106')">Yeah, mostly
                it was Googling, recovering from trauma. I did a little bit of research on former
                slaves, to see their mindset.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg106">Systems of Power: disability other</span></span></span> That was a little bit what I did use for the mindset
                of Missandei. Because people who've been in that situation, they go through, what is
                it called? No, goodness, I can't remember. But it was a very good article, and <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg82')">it
                was talking about how former slaves, they go through this process of not believing
                that they're free, and not believing that they're free, and not believing that
                they're free. And eventually, they get to a
                    point where it sticks in their head, that this is freedom. This is what they
                    have. No one can control them. And then, they get very, very almost violently
                    independent, where no one's going to tell me what to do. You can't tell me what
                    to do. No one's going to do that to me.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg82">Systems of Power: antiracism</span></span></span> Once again, how some
                people where to a much lesser extent, when you get out of controlling, overbearing
                relationships, and then you're finally free, and you're like, "Fuck that shit. Where
                am I going? I'm staying out all night. And I don't have to tell anybody."
            <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg83')">They get this burst of a sense of self, a
                    sense of purpose. And I thought that was very beautiful, that there are people
                    who can go through all that type of trauma, and they can get there, and they can
                    fully bloom. And I always saw Missandei as kind of that character, this
                    character who had gone through all of that to the point where here she is,
                    standing tall as a character that knows her own worth, knows her own

                so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
                Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit

        <p><strong>cara:</strong> No, that's great. Okay. I have a few questions,
            actually. I've been doing a little bit of basic data analysis on the <cite>Game of Thrones</cite>
            fandom on AO3. I've been looking at the most common ships, most common additional tags.
            I've also created a list of additional tags that I like and use, which is again sort of
            why I'm interested in tags so much, and it's reassuring that you're like, "<cite>Game of
            Thrones</cite> additional tags are very important." If you're in the document, I have a chart
            on the second page that has, what I've done is I looked at the most common ships, the
            most common additional tags, and the most common gender and sex pairings across
            different published dates, and how those published dates coincide with when seasons were
            aired on the TV show. I have those that were aired, those that were published during the
            times that Season One and Two were airing, those during the times that were published
            during Season Three and Four, et cetera, et cetera. I want to talk through some of the
            findings with you, and get your thoughts on how these more generalized findings
            represent the community.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Okay.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I guess we could start with most common ships.
            In the first few seasons, the most common ships were Jaime and Brienne. And towards the
            Seasons Five through Seven, we have Jon and Sansa. And then Season Eight is again Jaime
            and Brienne. What do you think of that shift?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> I can see why. Especially in Season Two, you
            get introduced to Jaime and Brienne, and their absolutely crazy chemistry. It's
            hilarious. It's funny to me that Jon Snow/Daenerys Targaryen is never like the main
            ship. That's kind of sad. That's my favorite. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg58')">But I can
                see, especially in Season Five, and Six, and Seven, where you see Jon Snow, Sansa
                Stark, because these two characters kind of get back together in the show. When
                they're together, you can see their dynamic in everything else. And they look good
                together. That's always a good thing. It's always big when it comes to shipping, who
                looks good with who.<span class="popuptext" id="wg58">Code: fan-politics, canon-compliant</span></span></span> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg107')">But I think people really enjoy the Jaime Lannister, Brienne of
                Tarth is kind of like the person, your frenemy. The person you love to hate.
            I would rescue you if you're falling off a cliff, but I'd probably punch you in the
            stomach when I got you back on solid land for being in that position to begin
            with.<span class="popuptext" id="wg107">Code: fan-politics, other</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. Some of the other common ships,
            depending on the seasons and the time, one of them is the Hound and Sansa. It appears
            quite frequently.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Oh yeah, San/San.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> And then, what was the other one? And then,
            Petyr and Sansa around Seasons Five and Six. I was wondering if you could talk a little
            through those two ships.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg59')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg107')">I actually liked
                Sandor Clegane, Sansa Stark as a pairing, whether it's through platonic, whether
                it's romantic, et cetera.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg107">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span> It was just one of those good ones. I thought they had
                good scene chemistry together. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg108')">I always thought he kind of saw her,
            especially in the beginning as, he called her a little bird. Like, "I see that your
            parents never prepared you for this. Your best safe kept in a cage locked away, and you
            can just sing to people."<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg108">Systems of Power: sexism</span></span></span> I always liked that about him.<span class="popuptext" id="wg59">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span> And then, his relationship with
            her kind of changed for me in Seasons Two, to Three, to Four, where she stands up to
            Joffrey, and she's like, "You can't kill somebody on their name day." And he kind of
            backs her up in her lie. I always thought that was a very good scene to me. It just kind
            of showed their dynamic a little bit. The deleted scenes are kind of creepy between the
            two of them. Did you ever see them on YouTube?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I have not.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg60')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg85')">Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
                    and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
                    stalker-y.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg85">Systems of Power: other sexism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="wg60">Code: canon-critique</span></span></span> But yeah, that's one ship that has been my
            personal favorite. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg61')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg109')">Sansa, Petyr, I've always hated that one, simply because he's grooming. It's
                    very obvious.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg109">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span> Where I can see Sansa starting to like Sandor
                because he would rebuff her at every turn if she started to show interest in him,
                even though he didn't want to. He'd just be like, "I can't deal with this. I can't
                deal with you." <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg100')">Petyr would relish that. He
                    does everything he can to get her into trusting him, and thinking of him as her
                    friend, and I would do anything for you, and that's really, really creepy. It's
                    always a surprise to me when I see Petyr Baelish, Sansa Stark fics especially
                    ones where it's not manipulative, and coercive, and creepy, I'm like, "What are
                    you guys seeing in that?" That's just odd.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="wg100">Systems of Power: other sexism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="wg61">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. Great. Thank you. And then, for most
            common additional tags, a lot of them are pretty expected. I think what was actually
            interesting for me, and I'm not sure if you have any thoughts on this, but in the
            earlier seasons, one of the most common tags was, "Noah English and Somali."</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yeah, I just saw that. I was like,
            "Huh."</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. It's fascinating.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Yes. Somali's been doing a lot of
            writing.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Most of it actually. 85, alternative universe,
            91, 95, 96. Yeah. They're up there. What happened?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I don't know, actually. That was something that
            was actually genuinely shocking that there was so many, that there were 85 published
            with the Somali tag, and that No English was the most common additional tag use. So I'm
            like, oh, I want to look more into that. But I just wanted to know if you had any
            thoughts. Everything else is... Yeah, I don't know. I don't know either.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> [crosstalk 00:57:04] by the same author? Is it
            a collection of authors? It just kind of blasted AO3?</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. No idea. Everything else from the
            additional tags is pretty normal, got AUs, and you've got canon divergence. A lot of
            fluff, a lot of angst, a little bit of smut. Well, a lot of smut.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> A lot of smut. Smut then romance, which is
            always <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:57:34].</span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. All right.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg62')">I like the modern setting. Modern setting seems to be the most
                common one.<span class="popuptext" id="wg62">Code: fan-politics, modern-setting</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Absolutely.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg63')">I think it's the same with, I'm also very
            active in the <cite>Star Wars</cite> fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of <cite>Star Wars</cite>,
            especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are and
            putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.<span class="popuptext" id="wg63">Code: fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake, modern-setting</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, I'm doing studies on <cite>The Legend of Korra</cite>
            too, and modern setting is really popular, especially high school settings. Modern high
            school.</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> I'm just like, "Do you people remember high
            school? Why are you doing this?"</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Why are you bringing this back?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> Exactly.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I wanted to ask, this is only the top five for
            each category across the seasons. A lot is missing, obviously. But is there anything
            that particularly strikes you as missing from the results?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:58:43]</span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'wg64')">canon divergence, angst, love, romance, smut. Not really. Everything seems to be kind of
            right where it should be, based on what I've seen. I'm trying to think of a tag that may
            be missing. No. Fluff, yeah, fluff's there, angst, romance. No, I think everything is
            there. You just randomly go on AO3, that's what you'd see.<span class="popuptext" id="wg64">Code: fan-politics, other</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> That's it. Those are the most popular tags.
            Awesome. That's all my questions. Do you have anything that you wanted to add before I
            end the recording?</p>
        <p><strong>writegirl:</strong> No. This was very interesting, thank you for
            choosing me.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, thank you for agreeing to do
            this.</p>
