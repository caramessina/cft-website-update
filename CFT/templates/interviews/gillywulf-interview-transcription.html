<h2>Interview</h2>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Today, on January 18, I am interviewing
            GillyWulf. Is that how you pronounce it, GillyWulf?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yep.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Okay. Awesome.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Correct.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Do you mind just saying your alias and
            just that you consent to being audio recorded?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yeah. My name is GillyWulf, and I consent to
            being audio recorded.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. All right. Okay. We're going to start
            with just basic questions about you as a fanfiction writer. Can you tell me a little bit
            about yourself as a fanfiction writer, when and how did you start writing fanfiction,
            which fandoms do you start with, how did your participation in fan communities change
            over the years, and what fandoms do you currently participate in and why? You don't have
            to answer all of those, but just to get sort of a nice perspective and picture of you as
            a fan.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Right. Okay. Well, I discovered fanfiction, it
            must have been middle school. It started with Naruto. I remember being mind-blown by the
            fact that, "Oh my god, they're continuing stories that I'm not going to see in canon.
            That's so cool." And I remember showing my friends and just losing myself in that. It
            was middle school, so everything you read then is shocking. That was in the stages of
            when, I think before fanfiction.net was purged and all that weird stuff. I never really
            got into LiveJournal, but that's a strange thing in and of itself. Yeah. So, I started
            writing a couple of things for that. And then, let's see, after that, I kind of put it
            down for a little while. And then, I want to say I picked it back up in high school.
                <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw001')">I hate that I did it, but I did real-person
                fanfiction for Paramore. Thinking of it now, it's always like, "God, that's not
                good. I shouldn't have done it, but here we are."<span class="popuptext" id="gw001">Code: reflection</span></span></span> And then, I moved from
            BuzzFeed, where I had done that, to Tumblr. And then, from there, I think that's when I
            started my Sherlock fandom. I think I did one or two things for that, and then found
            Legend of Korra and just dove head-first. That's kind of where I was like, "Okay, this
            is something I can do a lot of the time, just be I enjoy it," and all that. And now, I
            kind of do, I want to say mostly now is focused on Clexa, Clarke and Lexa from The 100,
            with a little bit of Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Yeah. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw002')">And from those three, you can see <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw075')">that they have
                    very female-centered stories.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw075">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span> And then,<span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw076')"> at least all three are those are canonically queer
                    characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
                    go,<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw076">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
                their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
                situation," so I try and write it when I can.<span class="popuptext" id="gw002">Code: important-quote, canon-relation, canon-compliant, motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Sorry, I have to unmute myself, so it's going
            to be a little awkward pause.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> No, I <span class="inaudible">[inaudible
                00:04:02].</span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. Can you tell me about texts you might
            have produced recently? I know, I think you finished the one that I'm asking you to talk
            about, No Matter the Universe, in 2018, which is-</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, I think the last thing I did was
            Roman Holiday for Clexa, Clarke and Lexa. It's always weird to say Clexa, because it
            doesn't sound like a real word. But I think before that, I also did kind of a longer
            thing for Assassin's Creed Odyssey. But right now, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw0020')">I'm
                trying to write something that's original, and that's always a bit more of an
                endeavor than you expect it to be.<span class="popuptext" id="gw0020">Code: reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> With the story that you're trying to write
            that's original, can you tell me a little bit about that story, and maybe how sort of
            your work in fanfiction connected with that trying to write sort of your own
            original?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Sure. Well, again, it has a lot of fleshing
            out to do, but it's basically this woman finds a kid on her property, who realizes he
            has this power and he wants to fix the things that are wrong in his society. She doesn't
            want to do it, but her wife convinces her to do it, and it's sort of the development of
            that relationship, and over time, the things they are able to fix or not.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> That sounds awesome. I would definitely read
            that.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> I hope so.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Okay. I want to talk a little bit about your
            actual texts now, No Matter the Universe, which is long and amazing.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> It is super long.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> It's 400 chapters. I was like, "Wow. Wow.
            That's amazing."</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Can you describe a little bit of your
            motivation behind writing this?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw003')">Well, it was definitely, when I first started it, it
                was, "Okay, well, I kind of just want to write, and I want to get better at writing,
                practicing it." I started it in college, and the professor I had at that time kept
                saying how, "If you want to get better at writing, you have to write 50,000 words,
                and then, you have to write another 50,000." "Really? All right. I'll just write,
                then. People will give me prompts and I'll just write those as they come in." And
                then, there were a lot of prompts that came in, surprisingly. I was able to stay
                consistent with it for, I want to say, two, three years.<span class="popuptext" id="gw003">Code: motivation</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw004')">And it's funny, going back to the original ones, the
                older ones at least, and reading those, because you sent me one. I think it was
                chapter 37 you mentioned in your email, and I went back and read it and I was like,
                "Oof, I could do this a lot better now, I hope."<span class="popuptext" id="gw004">Code: reflection</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw005')">Yeah. Just, I wanted to get better at it, and people
                were really good at giving me things that I could easily do at work,<span class="popuptext" id="gw005">Code: audience</span></span></span> and
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw006')">I didn't necessarily want to
                do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to a
                point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
                each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
                all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
                can't."<span class="popuptext" id="gw006">Code: vignette, motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Awesome. I'm really interested, for the genre
            that you chose with just 400 drabbles, which is amazing. So, can you talk a little bit
            about why, you said that you sort of didn't want to do full-length, but why was it sort
            of writing these shorter vignettes really appealing to you?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw007')">Well, I think for
                shorter things, there's a challenge in that you have, I think most of them ended up
                being 200-400 words, so you have to do an entire story in that time. You have to
                make somebody care about things that are happening in much fewer words, and make it
                more impactful in less amount of time. If you have 10,000 words to set up a
                situation and resolve it, and all that, it's definitely different from, "Here's just
                basically a gut punch of a story, and you maybe don't get the whole thing."<span class="popuptext" id="gw007">Code: vignette</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw008')">There's a couple that, I don't
                remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
                    <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:09:21]</span> on purpose, so that it had to be
                like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
                that.<span class="popuptext" id="gw008">Code: vignette, reflection</span></span></span> And also, I was in college when I started it, so a lot of that was
            time, too. I had a limited amount of time to spend on writing, that wasn't devoted to
            extracurriculars or classes, or just hanging out with my friends. So, that's sort of why
            the drabble compilation was what it was.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. I think what's
            really interesting about this collection, too, is it's all about audience engagement,
            which I'll probably ask you more questions about. But would you potentially want to talk
            through how you were thinking about your audience as you were writing?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw009')">Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
                was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
                think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
                prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
                I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
                I can sort of tailor it to that,"<span class="popuptext" id="gw009">Code: genre-other, audience</span></span></span> and you end up with ... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw010')">There's been
                a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
                always great. And I think the name was <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:11:19]</span>
                at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
                art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
                it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
                person's mind."<span class="popuptext" id="gw010">Code: fan-practices-uptake, genre-other, reception</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Can you talk through what you believe
            are some of the strengths of this entire collection? I know that can also vary, because
            it was sort of across two and a half years or so. But what do you believe some of the
            strengths of it are?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Let's see, what strengths? <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw011')">I like that a lot of people, I still get comments
                occasionally that are, "I've just gone through this whole thing," and you can do
                that.<span class="popuptext" id="gw011">Code: reception</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw012')">Even though it's 400 chapters, it's book-length. It's like a
                normal book length. It's easily digestible, and each thing's its own thing, so if
                you want to stop it and come back to it later, you can. People do usually, if you're
                feeling a specific mood, and go find that specific one and just go through a couple
                of those. I like that it's sort of, you don't have to have a super amount of
                emotional investment in it, like super long, 10-chapter fics that are 100,000
                words.<span class="popuptext" id="gw012">Code: vignette</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw013')">Like yes, it's very good. I enjoy it. But sometimes, I'm just in
                the mood for something light and I like that I can provide that for people who want
                that.<span class="popuptext" id="gw013">Code: fluff</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw014')">I also like that you can sort of see a progression of
                how I wrote them and how my own skills have maybe, hopefully developed. And even
                just, it did end up being four years' worth of time<span class="popuptext" id="gw014">Code: reflection</span></span></span>, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw015')">so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
                been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
                    <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw077')">And maybe, I think,
                    during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
                    different attitudes in that.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw077">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus homophobia-transphobia</span></span></span> I think those are some of the
                strengths in seeing that as well.<span class="popuptext" id="gw015">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, canon-resistant, reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. What were some of the
            challenges you faced while writing this text?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw016')">Well, the fact that
                it was short meant that I did only have a certain amount of words to deal with
                it.<span class="popuptext" id="gw016">Code: vignette</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw017')">So, if there were some things where I'd write the
                original drabble, and then I might get three more immediate requests in my inbox for
                a sequel, or for, "Can I get a full length thing of this?" And I didn't necessarily
                have the time or energy, or just the inclination in some cases.<span class="popuptext" id="gw017">Code: reception</span></span></span> There's one
            that I tried to start doing, and obviously that didn't end up going very far. There were
            definitely some like that. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw018')">And sometimes, there were just
                prompts that were not necessarily things that I wanted to do or actively didn't want
                to do<span class="popuptext" id="gw018">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span>, or maybe got repeats. And there was definitely, towards the later year
            or two of doing it, there were more prompts in my inbox than I had the time or energy
            for. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw019')">So, I would start to feel guilty, and sometimes
                would just push one out whether or not I felt it was up to par, even though I hoped
                it was.<span class="popuptext" id="gw019">Code: motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> You mentioned that there were prompts that you
            didn't really necessarily want to do. Can you talk about writing those and why you chose
            to write those, or if you decided to not write them?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Absolutely.<span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw020')"> I
            know it's, I don't want to say a popular trope, but <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw078')">it's a common trope in a lot of fanfiction communities, is the student-teacher
                    ... What is that? Student-teacher pairing, whatever. My dad is a teacher, so the
                    idea of that has always just absolutely not been something that I want to
                    encourage, and it just isn't good, so I don't like writing that, I don't like
                    reading it.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw078">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span> That's definitely one of the things. I'm sure
                there's been others, but that's always been a big one for me.<span class="popuptext" id="gw020">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. I'll probably ask more questions about
            that, because as I was reading that, I was noticing also your comments on those stories.
            But I'll ask you questions about that in a few minutes. I do have a question about
            feedback, which I'm sure, because you were working with prompts, you received so much
            feedback. Is there anything that stands out in particular to you about feedback you
            received?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw021')">I mean, most
                of it was positive, which was really good. If somebody really didn't like something,
                they didn't usually tell me. Or if they did, sometimes it was like a spelling error
                or a formatting error, and it'd be, "Okay, I can just easily fix that." I don't
                think there were too many outright negative things. There was one. I don't think it
                was on a prompt, but this artist I really liked at the time commented and said
                something like, "This would've been better with this movie instead of the one you
                actually used," and didn't necessarily anything positive otherwise. I don't know if
                they actually liked it, or if it was just sort of a, "Well, I would've liked it
                better if you'd done this thing the way I wanted you to." Which, it is what it is,
                and you sort of have to just say, "Okay, well, this is the way I did it, and I'm not
                going to change it." But it was definitely a situation where I was like, "Okay.
                Don't know what to make of that."<span class="popuptext" id="gw021">Code: reception</span></span></span> Sometimes, people would ... I don't know.
            I'm a lot less articulate out loud than I am on words, on typing, so things like this
            are always like, "Ugh." I'm trying my best. I know what things I want to say. But yeah.
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw022')">Most of the time, people are very, very happy about
                it, because it was just another thing for them to read.<span class="popuptext" id="gw022">Code: reception</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> If there's anything that you want to sort of
            also work through with writing in any of these answers at one point, you can always
            email me any kind of follow-up answers. If you're like, "Oh, I had this idea or
            question." You can always email me anything, any follow-ups that you have. This is not
            the end all be all and that's it.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Good to know.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So, if there's anything, if you have a moment
            where you're like, "Oh, I want to talk about this more," at some other point, you can
            write it down for yourself, or something like that. Or, if you want to go back through
            the questions at any point. I want to ask you about your tag. One of the things that I'm
            looking at in my dissertation is the way that additional tags are working. Archive of
            Our Own is amazing with the tagging system and discoverability. You chose sort of a
            bunch of different tags, Alternate Universe, Tumblr Prompts, Alternate Universe - Modern
            Setting, First Kiss, First Meeting, Friends to Lovers, Trans Character, Fake/Pretend
            Relationship, Public Displays of Affection, et cetera, et cetera. I think I have your
            list of tags there.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yeah, I'm looking at it.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. Great. How come you chose some of these
            tags? I know that, because there's so much content in your work, you probably had to
            think about multiple tags, but why these tags in particular? And how else might you tag
            the text?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw023')">Well, I'm
                very much a person who believes in, if you can't say it in like two words
                    <span class="inaudible">then you probably shouldn't</span>. So, I like to have it, what
                is this thing? And that's it. I like to be able to say, "This is what it's going to
                be," and it doesn't necessarily need to be more complicated than that.<span class="popuptext" id="gw023">Code: reflection</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw024')">I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
                get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
                distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to be
                able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
                somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
                something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
                looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
                and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
                is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.<span class="popuptext" id="gw024">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake, audience</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. I'm going to actually skip
            the next question. Actually, no. You know what? I'm not going to skip the next question.
            Why did you decide to focus on Korra and Asami?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Okay, well, at the time, let's see, again,
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw025')">I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
                don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
                came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
                into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
                ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that.<span class="popuptext" id="gw025">Code: canon-critique</span></span></span> And then, we just said, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw026')">"Okay, well, let's just do Korra next," because I was pretty sure
                that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
                of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
                of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
                watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it.<span class="popuptext" id="gw026">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span> And
            just for Korra and Asami, rather than necessarily Bolin, or whoever else. Let's see.
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw027')">I was very much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
                and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
                style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality.<span class="popuptext" id="gw027">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw028')">And then, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw0780')">just
                    seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
                    once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
                    not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
                    the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
                    there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw0780">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span>
            <span class="popuptext" id="gw028">Code: important-quote, canon-relation, fan-politics, critical-uptake</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw029')">Yeah. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw079')">And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
                    super forced<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw079">Systems of Power: heteronormativity</span></span></span>, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
                of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
                relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
                should take five steps back, and <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw080')">let's just
                    focus on these two.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw080">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="gw029">Code: canon-critique, critical-uptake</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. This is not a question on the interview,
            but I wanted to ask, what was your reaction in the season four finale?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> God. Okay.<span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw030')"> That was
                Christmas break, but my grandma was staying over for the weekend, so I had to watch
                it silently at like midnight, and freak out quietly. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw081')">As soon as Asami showed up on the screen, I must have lost
                    it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
                    happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw081">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="gw030">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. It was definitely a night that I will
            never forget.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Okay. Next, I'm going to ask you to sort of
            walk through some of your specific choices from your texts, as well as some general
            choices. The first is, what I really liked about your piece, and this probably has a lot
            to do with the sort of drabble genre, and sort of the inability to really dive into a
            longer story, but you really chose to mainly focus on sort of everyday things, and focus
            heavily on the joys of relationships and the excitement. There's a lot of fluff, little
            bit of angst. So, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about why focusing sort
            of on the everyday, and focusing on happiness and sort of the comfort of that intimacy
            was important for you.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw0300')">Yeah. Well, absolutely
                part of it was wish fulfillment. I've never been in any sort of relationship, so it
                was like, "Okay, this is might what it be like." But also, I'm a big fan of the fact
                that, of using fanfiction, or TV shows, or movies, or any of that as escapism.
            <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw082')">You look out your window and things are just not
                    good a lot of the time,<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw082">Systems of Power: other</span></span></span>
            <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw083')">so I really like reading things that are just
                    soft and maybe things aren't so terrible for them where they are, and just sort
                    of getting lost in the idea of, they can just relax. They've been through so
                    much, they deserve a little bit of something that's not going to hurt them, with
                    somebody who definitely wants the same for them, who wants the same for
                    themselves.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw083">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> I tried to make that as a focus. Yeah, I just
                really wanted that.<span class="popuptext" id="gw0300">Code: fluff</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. I feel like that was definitely really
            coming through as I was reading, so just letting you know that that definitely worked. I
            was like, "Oh, this is nice."</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Good.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> "This makes me feel nice and warm." Okay. I was
            wondering if you could talk a little bit about moments when Asami and Korra notice each
            other, and sort of observe each other. I have a few different quotes in the document
            that I sent you. But there's so many more, so I wonder if you could talk a little bit
            through sort of those observations and descriptions?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Sure. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw031')">Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
                different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
                know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
                way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
                So, I tried to mix it up on occasion.<span class="popuptext" id="gw031">Code: vignette, audience</span></span></span> But the ones in the document are maybe
            just, a lot of them seem to be, well, not a lot of them, one or two seem to be meeting
            for the first time. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw032')">And
                okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
                notice?<span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw084')"> And for Korra, she's an imposing
                    figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw084">Systems of Power: feminism</span></span></span>,
                <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw085')">she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
                    Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw085">Systems of Power: racism</span></span></span> So, those
                things stand out immediately.<span class="popuptext" id="gw032">Code: canon-compliant, reception</span></span></span> Also her energy. And I always like to think of
            her as sort of, and especially you can sort of see it in, I want to say the finale of
            season three, where she's going, she's in the Avatar State, and she's just using all of
            her powers all at once, and being an absolute mass of power. And that's something she
            can turn on at will, pretty much. That's part of who she is as a character, and that's
            always just beneath the surface, easy for her to get to. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw033')">Even in the modern drabbles, or the
                other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
                she can access that.<span class="popuptext" id="gw033">Code: canon-compliant, genre-other</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw034')">And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
                gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
                age, she's sad and <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw086')">growing up with the rich father,
                    she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
                    life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
                    all the time.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw086">Systems of Power: class</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="gw034">Code: canon-compliant</span></span></span> It does also come down to that. And when
            they first meet in canon, even tough Korra's a little bit less than impressed, Asami is
            immediately like, "I want to know you. I want to be friends with you." She's eager to
            know her, and that's great. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw035')">I loved that. Even if, and I think
                once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
                maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw087')">Initially, it was definitely harder to see
                    that<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw087">Systems of Power: heteronormativity</span></span></span>, but <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw088')">I liked that they
                    weren't immediate, for the most part.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw088">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="gw035">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw036')">They wanted to be friends first, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw089')">but they were so good together that I wanted to be able to
                    sometimes just say they can be immediate,<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw089">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> sometimes.<span class="popuptext" id="gw036">Code: canon-resistant</span></span></span>
            Let's see, <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:31:14]</span> used. Yeah. We notice immediately
            that Asami's gorgeous and then, I'm going backwards here, but you notice immediately
            that Korra's jacked and that it's there. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw037')">Things like that, you notice immediately, but also that
                it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it. I
                don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
                trying to get portrayed.<span class="popuptext" id="gw037">Code: vignette, audience</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. I'm going to actually jump
            down to my question about sort of the different relationships that Korra and Asami's
            parents have with them, and their own relationship, just because you mentioned Asami's
            dad, and that was a theme that I sort of kept seeing pop up across your different
            pieces. Can you describe a bit about the different relationships you imagined between
            Korra and Asami and their parents? Like Korra's parents, you often portray as loving and
            accepting, while Asami's dad is portrayed as homophobic and bitter, and that Asami's
            mom, in one chapter, is very accepting and loving. Why was it so important for you to
            spend time looking at their different parental relationships?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Okay, there's a couple reasons. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw038')">The first being that we
                only get a certain amount of them in canon.<span class="popuptext" id="gw038">Code: implicit-explicit, motivation</span></span></span> For Korra's parents, we do see
            that they are immediately, "Okay, this is what our daughter is. We better figure out how
            to work around it, rather than try and change it or fix it," because when your kid is
            throwing rocks and water, and all of that, immediately, you're like, "Okay, well, this
            is the situation." <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw039')">So, it's kind of just how I always
                imagined her parents were just going to always be there for her. And we do see that
                in season three, where she's immediately going to bat for them and each
                other.<span class="popuptext" id="gw039">Code: canon-compliant</span></span></span> For Asami, we know immediately that her relationship with her dad is
            complicated, and that, since her mom isn't in the picture, he's a little bit more
            distant, and that a lot of distant parents don't necessarily know how to interact with
            their kids and don't necessarily ... Some of them make a version of their kid in their
            head that doesn't necessarily line up. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw040')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw090')">So, at the same time,
                    it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
                    since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
                    until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
                    a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
                    decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
                    this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
                    case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
                    Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
                    bit.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw090">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="gw040">Code: important-quote, canon-relation, fan-politics, fan-practices-uptake, motivation</span></span></span> And especially for Asami, since her mom wasn't in
            the picture, she really only had the one parent to go off of, and she was often
            described as the, well, not often, since they really only mentioned her a couple times,
            but she was sort of thought of, I believe, as the softer of the two parents. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw041')">So, I just tried to stay true to that, I guess, in some
                regard, as far as her relationship went.<span class="popuptext" id="gw041">Code: canon-compliant</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. And thank you for sharing
            that.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> No problem.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Chapter 37, which I know you mentioned you went
            back and read, and you're like, "Oh, I could do this much differently now."</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> I hope.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I was really interested in this chapter, and
            it's sort of a reoccurring theme that I've seen across Korrasami fan fics of sort of
            touch being a big trigger, for Korra especially. Can you talk a little bit more about
            the chapter and Korra's panic attack for being handcuffed, the representations of
            trauma, and sort of the ideas of consent around bondage as well?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yeah. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw042')">Well, for that chapter, I want to say, like everything
                else in the collection, it was a prompt, but it was something that I didn't want to
                ham-fist it, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw091')">because Korra's definitely, she's
                    traumatized.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw091">Systems of Power: disability</span></span></span> We see that more than once,<span class="popuptext" id="gw042">Code: canon-compliant, motivation</span></span></span> immediately
            from season <span class="inaudible">one</span> she has multiple nightmares, she forces herself
            to stay awake more than once. She's scared and she feels like she can't show it. So,
            even though she does talk about her emotions, I want to say fairly regularly, it's not
            always as easy for her as maybe Bolin, or as succinct as anybody else could be, so I
            have to imagine that, sometimes, it's not easy for her and it doesn't always come out.
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw043')"> So, in this one in particular, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw092')">she's trying to have a good experience and maybe power
                    through it, but then, in that brief lapse where she forgets that she's tied down
                    and then she tries to sit up, it's sort of like a muscle memory thing, where
                    she's back there the last time she was chained up and couldn't
                    move.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw092">Systems of Power: disability</span></span></span> But also, at the same time, I wanted Asami to immediately
                be there and to be immediately helpful and not push her. She was just trying to be
                comforting.<span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw093')"> You hear stories about how people
                    try and be helpful and just make situations worse<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw093">Systems of Power: abelism</span></span></span>, but at this
                point in their relationship, Korra and Asami knew each other super well, and even
                though this is an unusual situation for them, Asami knows how Korra reacts and knows
                who she is and what she's thinking. She's able to help her come back slowly, rather
                than try and make it a quick thing.<span class="popuptext" id="gw043">Code: reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Thanks. And I know you sort of mentioned that,
            if you were going to redo it and redo this chapter, you would want to do it differently.
            Do you want to explain a little bit about how you might want to, ooh, explain a little
            about how you might want to redo it differently?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Sure. Again, this chapter 37 out of 400, so
            it's just, I wrote it really early. It must have been 2014. If you go back and read the
            later ones, if you go and read more recent things that I've published, it's sort of a
            different style, it's sort of a different tone, because after that, I wrote 100,000 more
            words, and put the effort in to learn from other writers. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw044')">So, I think I'd notice, not spacing errors, pacing
                errors in that, I could've slowed that down a bit, I could've drawn the reader in a
                little bit more, just things like that, where it's just like, "I maybe know how to
                write now," so it hopefully could've made it a little bit more
            engaging.<span class="popuptext" id="gw044">Code: reflection</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I think that, even though it was years ago, and
            I definitely understand reading your own writing from years ago and being like, "Oh no,"
            I think it was still really well written. I think that it was still very thoughtfully
            done, and your descriptions are really engaging. But I definitely understand being like,
            "Oh no." Okay. The next question I want to ask is about your choices around trans Korra,
            both male-to-female, and female-to-male transgender representation. You have one chapter
            on male-to-female, and then three chapters on female-to-male, and I guess maybe that's
            because, I'm assuming someone prompted it. Can you talk a little about your inspiration
            behind ... Oh, and you also have a chapter on gender-fluid Korra. Can you talk a little
            bit about your inspiration behind this? Yeah. Yeah, I was reading more and I was like,
            "Oh."</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> [crosstalk 00:41:32], "Oh yeah, I did do that
            [crosstalk 00:41:36]."</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yeah. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw045')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw094')">Well, again, it was the prompts, but it was
                    also, I have personally been a little conflicted on gender for a while, and it's
                    like my sexuality, it was something that I sort of just say, "Well, I'll get to
                    that when I have the chance."<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw094">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> So, it's always just sort of in
                the back of my head<span class="popuptext" id="gw045">Code: motivation</span></span></span>, and like with Korra's parents, it's situations where I
            want good outcomes for this, so <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw046')">I
                try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw095')">she's living the life that she wanted to live with a person she loves, doing
                    something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
                    complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
                    obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw095">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> But
                yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
                be happy.<span class="popuptext" id="gw046">Code: fluff, reflection</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw047')"><span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw096')">And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
                    that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
                    most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
                    see what they're going through and you see how their lives are<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw096">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span>,
                and I try not to speak for situations that I've never lived through, but you can
                draw knowledge from that and say, "Okay, well, without going in depth into feelings
                or things like that, I can add this, this, and this, and make it maybe relatable in
                that regard."<span class="popuptext" id="gw047">Code: fan-politics, research</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. Can you talk a little about,
            this kind of goes back to what we were talking about before and how you got some prompts
            that you didn't want, especially the teacher-student prompts. Maybe not didn't want, but
            were unsure about.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Oh, I didn't want them.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> You're like, "No." So, I think what's really
            important is that you sort of set boundaries in your writing. In chapter 156, where
            Korra is Asami's student, Asami sets boundaries. And in your comment, someone asked in
            one of the comments if you could sort of potentially show their relationship, or
            something like that, and you were like, "I don't want to do that. That bothers me." Oh,
            and then, in another one, you had a prompt that was Korra as Asami's slave, and you
            chose to make it about liberation rather than potentially make it sexual or intimate.
            So, I wanted to ask if you could talk a little bit through how these sort of prompts
            that could get really uncomfortable, and I guess sort of similar to what you're saying
            about the trans prompts, too, where you don't necessarily know that experience, but
            prompts where you have to sort of navigate these really uncomfortable things, or these
            power dynamics that can sort of manifest through these prompts. I don't know if that
            made sense.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> No, I can figure it out. Let's see. Well, I
            think it's a good idea not to write things that make you 100% uncomfortable. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw048')">And especially for this, it's not a
                serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
                just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
                things that made me super uncomfortable.<span class="popuptext" id="gw048">Code: fluff, motivation</span></span></span> I think there was an early one that
            I made, maybe not sex, but it was maybe a little more intimate than I had ever written
            before, and I was writing it and I was like, "Hmm, this is maybe not something I should
            do." <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw049')">And it's also, given the
                audience, this is considered a family show. So, I realized over time that maybe I
                don't have to write that.<span class="popuptext" id="gw049">Code: fan-politics, audience</span></span></span> There's people who love writing smut, and that's
            totally fine for them. There's a million places you can find it. I read it occasionally,
            that's fine, but maybe it's not something I have to write. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw050')">If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
                it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
                press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw097')">Because I just find keeping people as slaves is super ... I didn't want to
                    contribute to it<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw097">Systems of Power: antiracism</span></span></span>, and it was just that sort of idea

                more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
                been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
            thing.<span class="popuptext" id="gw050">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, critical-uptake, audience</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you for talking through that. I
            know it can be sort of difficult to talk through navigating tensions and navigating
            power dynamics in writing. So, my final question out of my 400, about your text, because
            I do have two other questions-</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> That's just fine. I mean, I've got nothing
            else today.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Just talk for hours.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Good.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So, your final chapter, which is chapter 400,
            it's so interesting to see the first chapter to the last chapter. And I think you talked
            a lot about it's about practice and you sort of developed as a writer. Why did you
            decide to stop at chapter 400? Why did you decide to end with that story?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Well, it had a lot to do with, I think at the
            point of writing it, I got to 390 and I sort of had a little bit moved on to other
            fandoms where, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw051')">even
                though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
                for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it.<span class="popuptext" id="gw051">Code: canon-compliant, motivation</span></span></span> So, I was
                <span class="inaudible">moving on</span> and 390 was really bothering me. So, I was like,
            "Okay, I'll get to 400, and I can sort of ... Four is my favorite number, so we'll just
            leave it at that." And for that last one, I actually reread it today, because you
            mentioned it. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw052')">It was
                partially based on a drawing by <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 00:50:02]</span> that had
                Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City,<span class="popuptext" id="gw052">Code: fan-practices-uptake, motivation</span></span></span>
            and <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw053')">I wanted it to, like everything
                else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
                to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it.<span class="popuptext" id="gw053">Code: fluff, motivation</span></span></span> Even just the writing
            of it, especially when looking back to the older stories ... <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw054')">There's a writer, whose name I always mess up. I want to
                say it's <span class="inaudible">coeurdastronaute</span>. They do a lot of Clarke and Lexa
                stuff, but she sets the scene super well with like, "Here's the sky. Here's the
                roads. Here's the this," and I tried to emulate that.<span class="popuptext" id="gw054">Code: fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span> And I really do think
            it turned out well, not to toot my own horn, but I did really like it. So, I tried to
            emulate that a little bit and just to say, they're going to be in love for a while. It
            is what it is, and this is how their lives are going to be. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw055')">And I also wanted to give the collection itself a
                sendoff I was proud of. So, I spent a little bit more time on that than I did a lot
                of the other stuff, just let it marinate. "You know what? This is a good end, and
                hope you enjoyed," sort of thing.<span class="popuptext" id="gw055">Code: motivation</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah, I think ... Oh, I just realized that I
            did not mute myself that time. Okay. Okay. Hopefully it wasn't loud and clacky. Yeah. I
            really loved that ending. I thought that ending was just, I thought it was like, "Oh,
            this is just wonderful."</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Thanks.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So, you've talked a little bit about your
            development. I'm wondering if you could talk just generally about what you learned from
            writing across the four years, about your development as a writer, your understanding of
            audience and your ability to continue a creative momentum, because that is quite a
            feat.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yeah. Well, I can start off with momentum very
            easily. For the first, oh god, I want to say year, year and a half, I wrote multiple
            prompts a day for that whole time, and it was a lot. I found that I got burned out, and
            it was really hard to continue a lot of those. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw056')">So now,
                I sort of write when I want to, when I have the motivation. And if I'm feeling it,
                yeah, I'll do a little bit. Like somebody requested a prompt two weeks ago. I was
                like, "You know what? Why not. I'm feeling it. We're going to go for it."<span class="popuptext" id="gw056">Code: motivation</span></span></span> So,
            there's definitely that. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw057')">I learned to just not push it,
                don't write what other people are demanding, necessarily.<span class="popuptext" id="gw057">Code: audience</span></span></span> Take a breather,
            let you get your pace. Let's see, what else? To vary sentence length. To maybe spend
            more time on descriptions than I would've otherwise. That it's okay to feel the mood. I
            write a lot with music, which I didn't when I started. I try and put a song that I
            really want the mood for, and just write through that until I find something that ...
            Until I either get through that scene, or I need to move to a different mood. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw058')">And it's okay to learn from other writers. Like I said
                with <span class="inaudible">coeurdastronaute</span>, everything she writes is like, "I'm in
                love with this. It's great. How can I maybe write something similar to that? What
                parts can I take from this that I want to emulate?"<span class="popuptext" id="gw058">Code: fan-practices-uptake</span></span></span> Let's see. I'm sorry. I'm
            getting there. I'm getting there. I promise. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw059')">Especially with the prompts and setting boundaries like you
                mentioned earlier. It's writing what you want.<span class="popuptext" id="gw059">Code: fan-politics, critical-uptake</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw060')">My audience should be myself, at the end of the day. I
                want to write the things that I want to read. Even if I'd much rather prefer just
                reading it and not having to put the time and effort into clacking my way through
                it, if I want to read it, I have to write it sometimes, which is fine. But I should
                enjoy the things that I'm writing.<span class="popuptext" id="gw060">Code: audience</span></span></span> And there are a couple that I go back
            through and I go, "Man, I really loved writing this, and I still think it's very good."
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw061')">And it's okay that maybe only three other people
                also liked it, but I like it.<span class="popuptext" id="gw061">Code: reception</span></span></span> I would say those are the biggest
            things.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I like it, too.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Thank you.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you. That was really concise and
            well thought out. My last round of questions is, I'm doing a little bit of data
            analytics, and I think I actually sent you the article I published.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Something at the bottom of the
            email.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yes.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> I'm very bad about answering
                <span class="inaudible">emails.</span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> No, that's totally fine. I have to be good at
            answering emails. It's part of my job, and I hate it. Okay. I want to just give sort of
            a few general findings and trends from data analysis and sort of get your thoughts and
            perspectives on why those trends might be. Before Korra and Asami really became canon or
            subtextual in the show, like before the end of season three, most of the relationships,
            or a large majority of them were Korra and Mako, or Korra and Tahno, or Korra and Bolin,
            those sorts of relationships. Why do you think, at first, that was sort of more central
            in the fan community?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw062')">Oh,
            <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw098')">the easy answer is sexism,
                    because everyone sees the main heroine next to a cute boy and decides, "That's
                    good. I'm going to do that," without maybe necessarily putting much more thought
                    into it.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw098">Systems of Power: sexism heteronormativity</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="gw062">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span> Like we saw, especially in season three,
            there's much more of a development of Korra and Asami's relationship. That whole, they
            get lost in the desert and they have to beat up the airship people, and then, the random
            thugs on motorcycles from Mad Max. There's that whole thing, and you see them working
            together super well. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw063')">Obviously, there's always going to be people who say,
                <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw099')">"I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
                    care whether or not they necessarily gel."<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw099">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span> I'm sure there's
                people ... I feel like I went back a million years ago and looked at the first
                Korrasami fics, just out of curiosity, to see when they were published, and I'm sure
                that they were like episode one, because it's just what people do, and it's great.
                Ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon.<span class="popuptext" id="gw063">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, canon-resistant</span></span></span> So, at that
            time, there was a lot of that. And then later, Bryan and Mike went back and said that,
            "We were trying to actively develop through season three, so thank you for noticing."
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw064')">So, it was there, but
                it's not surprising that a lot of people who aren't looking for it don't go and see
                it. <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw100')">A lot of
                    straight people I know will look at a lot of these relationships and say, "Oh,
                    that came from nowhere."<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw100">Systems of Power: heteronormativity homophobia-transphobia</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="gw064">Code: important-quote, fan-politics</span></span></span> Like, when Lexa and Clarke
            kissed in The 100, a lot of people said, "I have no idea where that came from." I'm
            like, "Okay, you're not looking at all." So, it's that sort of thing, and I'm not at all
            surprised by that.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you for that thorough answer. So,
            around October 2014, which is actually when you published your piece, there was a huge
            spike, both in fan engagement and fan publishing in The Legend of Korra fandom in
            Archive of Our Own, but also, of course, in Korrasami fics. Why do you think that
            is?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Well, October was the end of season three, I
            believe. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw065')">At the end of season three, we saw that development and
                we saw, especially during Korra's fight with Zaheer, Asami looked the most scared
                out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her
                recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw101')">"That's a little gayer than it maybe should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
                    of people took that and decided to go with it<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw101">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span>, especially since
                the relationship was <span class="inaudible">[inaudible 01:00:21]</span>, whether or not ...
                Again, and at that time, we didn't know the writer's intention, so it was just
                everybody, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw102')">or at least Korrasami fans, picking
                    up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
                    so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
                    happen."<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw102">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="gw065">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, implicit-explicit</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. And then, finally, the next sort of big
            spike is, of course, the series finale, which was December 2014, because apparently
            season three and four came out very close to each other. I didn't remember
            that.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> It was only like a couple of weeks or
            something.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. It was nuts. It was like, "Oh, okay.
            We're just going right into it."</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> So, in December 2014 and January 2014, there
            was another huge spike. I can't remember the exact number. I should actually probably
            write that down. But it was a lot of fanfictions were published, and I think a large
            majority of them were Korrasami. Why do you think it is that people were so drawn to
            their relationship and so drawn to the series finale and that sort of canonical moment
            that confirmed that they were bi?</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw066')">Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
                was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
                possible love interests.<span class="popuptext" id="gw066">Code: canon-relation, canon-compliant</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw067')">Tahno was just a bully that people decide ... I don't
                understand why people like that, but people do.<span class="popuptext" id="gw067">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span> And her whole thing with Mako
            was just her expectation of what romance should be, and Mako was hot, "Mako is cool,
            Mako's interesting, so I have to be in love with him." And Bolin ended up more as like a
            brother, because he was also pretty young at that time, I think. I want to say he was
            like 15 when the series started, or something close to that, so he also didn't know what
            he was looking for either. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw068')">So, we spend four seasons developing
                Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
                lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
                out<span class="popuptext" id="gw068">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span>, and especially since, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw069')"> immediately after
                    the season finale aired, everyone was sort of unsure like, "<span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw103')">This is canon, right? This is canon. That's what this looks
                    like<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw103">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span>,"<span class="popuptext" id="gw069">Code: fan-politics</span></span></span> and then, Mike and Bryan immediately posted that
            long Tumblr post, both of them, saying, <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw070')">"Korrasami's canon. That's
                what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw104')">especially since, up to that point, there really hadn't been
                    a whole lot of huge representation for female ships.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw104">Systems of Power: LGBTQplus</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="gw070">Code: important-quote, fan-politics, canon-compliant</span></span></span> I
            think Bubbline was still very much subtext at that point, and Steven Universe hadn't
            quite premiered yet. What are the other big ones? She-Ra didn't come out until last
            year. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw071')">So, these big cartoons that are for kids are doing more
                for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
                kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
                much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust."<span class="popuptext" id="gw071">Code: genre-other</span></span></span>
            <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw072')">So, to
                see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
                god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
                have to imagine people took off with it.<span class="popuptext" id="gw072">Code: canon-compliment, fan-politics, canon-compliant</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Great. Thank you for that thorough response.
            That's sort of my theory behind it, too.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> I guess it's pretty obvious you know the
            community well. You're like, "That's it."</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. I'm doing Game of Thrones as the other
            fandom I'm looking at, so it's very different.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yes.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> It's very, very different.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> It's the total opposite.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. I'm interviewing my first writer, who did
            a Game of Thrones fic tomorrow, and I'm really excited to sort of see her difference of
            perspective. I'm like, "Ooh, this is going to be fun." But yeah. No, I think that Legend
            of Korra was revolutionary, and it was amazing.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yeah, yeah. It was so important. <span class="code"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw073')">And it was also <span class="power-identity"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'gw105')">good that
                    nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
                    communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
                    white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
                    frankly.<span class="systems-of-power-popuptext" id="gw105">Systems of Power: antiracism</span></span></span><span class="popuptext" id="gw073">Code: canon-compliment</span></span></span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. 100%. Especially Game of Thrones. Yeah. I
            mean, a lot of what I'm focusing on in Legend of Korra is around sexuality and gender
            roles. A lot of what I'm looking at at Game of Thrones is about race, because that show
            has got its issues, like most things. Great. I think that's sort of it with the
            interview portion, unless there's anything else you want to add.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> No. I think I did my best to put everything
            out there as well as I could.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. No, thank you so much for that. You did a
            wonderful job. I know that it can be very hard to talk through and also talk for like an
            hour about it.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> I mean, hey, <span class="inaudible">[inaudible
                01:06:46].</span></p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Go on forever. All right.</p>
        <p><strong>gillywulf:</strong> Yeah. I love Korra and Asami. I will talk
            about it whenever I can.</p>
        <p><strong>cara:</strong> Yeah. No, they're amazing. Okay, I'm going to
            stop the audio recording.</p>
