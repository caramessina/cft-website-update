  <section><h1>About the Critical Fan Toolkit (CFT)</h1>
    <p>Everyone is a fan of something. Fan communities can be found everywhere, from online forums, to conventions like Comic Con or RuPaul’s DragCon, to the parking lot of a baseball game, to a concert hall. Fans have shaped our culture and how texts are consumed; they speak, and production companies and textual creators listen. Fan communities develop and implement particular practices, and often these practices shift depending on the context.</p>
    <p>The CFT explores composing practices fanfiction — specifically fanfiction written about <cite>The Legend of Korra</cite> (TLOK) and Game of Thrones (GOT) — that resist or subvert white supremacy, racism, misogyny, and ableism. Everyday fan practices can challenge harmful, dominant ideologies to instead celebrate all types of bodies, knowledges, and identities that are often ignored, erased, or have violence enacted upon; our practice range from the types of texts we consume and how we choose to respond to these texts.</p>

<p><strong>Define and trace composing practices that critical fans use.</strong> These composing practices are traced through an analysis of two fandoms — TLOK and GOT — from <em>Archive of Our Own</em> as well as interviews from individual fanfiction writers. Critical fans challenge the systems of oppression that are represented in either the cultural materials they take up or the actual fandoms in which they participate. . While you may not be a fan of TLOK or GOT, each of us have our own fan communities — from fans of a particular cultural material to political fans to sports fans — in which we’re invested. By defining and tracing critical fan composing practices and uptakes, we can bring these practices into our own fandoms.</p>

<p><strong>Provide critical fan pedagogy resources for both outside of and within traditional learning spaces, such as classrooms</strong>. Pedagogy, in its simplest definition, is the methods and theories around teaching and learning. Critical fan pedagogy centers challenging systems of oppression through fan practices. This toolkit can also help you develop your own data literacy and research skills. The CFT offers <a href="{{ url_for('homepath_teacher') }}">teaching resources</a>, <a href="{{ url_for('dis_computational_essays') }}">computational notebooks to practice Python to transform data</a>, and <a href="{{ url_for('ffd_numbers') }}">interactive visualizations to be analyzed</a>.

<p><strong>Demonstrate how to conduct research and make arguments using data</strong>. Demonstrate how to conduct research and make arguments using data. This project uses a mixture of a large corpus (TLOK and GOT fanfiction published on AO3) as well as interview data. Even though this toolkit specifically focuses on the composing practices from two fandoms and writers from each, these methods may be applied across fanfiction and other fan genres. </p>

<h2>Project Commitments</h2>
<p><p>The CFT is a dissertation project created by <a href="{{ url_for('dis_about_cara') }}">Cara Marta Messina</a>, a Ph.D. candidate in the English department focusing on Writing and Rhetoric at Northeastern University (defense date: March 25th, 2021). This project believes deeply in fanfiction and other everyday fandom practices as a method for resisting, reimagining, and refusing to conform to systems of power. However, this critical fan work is not inherent, but is instead developed and learned.  Because of this commitment, CFT is a public dissertation available to all fans with internet access. This toolkit seeks to explore and provide guidelines for bettering our everyday practices to be more ethical, critical, and justice-centered fans.</p>

<h2>Why Fanfiction?</h2>

<p>Fan communities are created around the enjoyment of cultural materials or artifacts — such as a television show, movie, book, or celebrity. Fans are various ages, races, genders, sexualities, socioeconomic statuses, and educational backgrounds. Fans in fan communities discuss the original cultural materials through forums or other forms of communication, produce materials that reimage the original materials such as fan art or fanfiction, cosplay (or “costume play”), and other modes of engagement. </p>
<p>One important phenomenon that occurs in fan communities is writing fanfiction. While not all fans write fanfiction, all who write fanfiction participate in fan communities. One of the major goals of fanfiction is to explore, reimagine, and claim democratic ownership over the original cultural materials’ stories, characters, and universes. Reimagining stories has been around as long as stories have. Virgil’s <cite>Aeneid</cite> (29—19 BC) revolves around the character <cite>Aeneas</cite>, from Homer’s <cite>Iliad</cite>. Postcolonial retellings, like Jean Rhys’ <cite>Wide Sargasso Sea</cite> and J. M. Coetzee’s <cite>Foe</cite>, reimages canonical tales from different perspectives to share erased stories. Before the internet, non-professional fanfiction writers — writers who are not paid for their labors — used to publish, writer for, and read fan-created zines to share their work (Russ, 1985). Today, there are various online spaces where fanfiction writers publish their work, such as <cite>Fanfiction.net</cite>, <cite>Tumblr</cite>, <cite>Deviant Art</cite>, <cite>WattPad</cite>, and <cite>Archive of Our Own</cite>. Whether fanfiction online, in-person, or circulated through snail mail, fanfiction writing publics allow fans to engage in conversations with other fans, provide and receive feedback on writing, and celebrate each other as well as the cultural materials that they love. </p>
<p>This dissertation focuses on a specific faction of fanfiction writers: critical fans. <strong>Critical fans</strong> are fans of any cultural material or icon(s) who challenge or subvert systems of oppression — such as racism, misogyny, heteronormativity, homophobia, and ableism — through their everyday fan engagements, such as writing/reading fanfiction, posting on forums, and creating fan art. The phrase "critical fans" comes from the works of andré carrington, Paul Booth, Rukmini Pande, Alexis Lothian, and other fan scholars, as these fan scholars point to how fans can resist forms of oppression.</p>

<h2>CFT as a Scholarly Intervention</h2>
<p>I build upon the scholarly and public conversations happening in writing/rhetoric studies, fan studies, and in fandoms. Fan studies is an interdisciplinary field that appears in media and new media studies, writing studies, digital humanities, communications, and other fields that examine participatory cultures and cultural texts. Writing studies is invested in writer-reader relationships, focusing on context, rhetoric, and audience — how can writers successfully convey and develop particular arguments and creative ideas to reach particular audiences in particular times and publics? This toolkit thinks through how fans, specifically critical fans, are always-already rhetorically engaged, engaging in an ever-changing media and social media landscape while simultaneously resisting normative narratives around gender, sexuality, ability status, and race.</p>
<p>The overarching research question in this dissertation is: How and why do fans resist harmful cultural ideologies in their uptakes of fan genres? Based on this question, this dissertation will explore three questions below. To learn more about the methods I use to explore these questions, visit the “<a href="{{ url_for('dis_methods') }}">Methods</a>” section.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can the resistance to or the reinforcement of cultural ideologies be traced in fanfiction genres?</li>
  <li>How can critical fandom practices be traced in fans’ uptakes of the original cultural material and fanfiction genres?</li>
  <li>How can critical fan pedagogies be made useable for instructors and fans alike?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Frameworks</h2>
<p>This dissertation brings together two frameworks: critical fandoms and rhetorical genre studies (rhetorical genre studies). <a href="{{ url_for('dis_framework')}}">To read more about both frameworks, visit the dissertation frameworks section</a>.</p>
