<h1>About Cara Marta Messina</h1>
<p><a href="https://caramartamessina.com/">Cara Marta Messina</a> [she/her] is a PhD candidate focusing on Writing and Rhetoric in Northeastern University’s English Department.

<p>I am is a white cisgender woman who grew up in Queens, New York. I have been participating in fandoms since she was young. I began by writing my own <cite>Inuyasha</cite> fanfiction in a large, black binder that I would pass around to my friends in theater club. I then discovered the wonders of fandoms on <cite>Quizilla</cite>, <cite>Fanfiction.net</cite>, and other digital spaces. In my early years on fandoms, I never thought deeply about the role of race, gender, sexuality, and disability in my own fandom participation. As I grew older, though, I learned about the importance of representational politics and power from my friends, online fandom networks, and dipping my toes into theory and fan studies.</p>
<p>Since then, I often reflect on why my fanfiction and fan activities so often revolved around the erasure of women and centering whiteness in my fanfics. Even though I was writing about animes and the characters were predominatenly Japanese, I still approached writing about these characters with an assumed whiteness. I hope this CFT provides a space for fans — especially fans invested in learning about and critiquing the complexities of positionalities, ideologies, and power — a place to reflect on the complexities of fandoms.</p>

<p>Outside of my work, I watch a bit too much <cite>Sailor Moon</cite> and Twitch streamers. I also bring my pup, Efi, everywhere. My hobbies revolve around reading, gaming, watching/streaming on Twitch (<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/itsloyalpizza">ItsLoyalPizza</a>, for anyone interested), falling into coding holes, and imagining that I will someday make my own cosplays. I love my friends dearly and believes professional and academic settings should celebrate friendships and kinships.</p>

<p>Fandoms she currently or previously belonged to: <cite>Sailor Moon</cite>, <cite>The Legend of Korra</cite>, <cite>Avatar: The Last Airbender</cite>, <cite>Game of Thrones</cite>, <cite>Death Note</cite>, <cite>Yu Yu Hakusho</cite>, <cite>Buffy the Vampired Slayer</cite>, <cite>Angel</cite>, <cite>The Hunger Games</cite>, <cite>How to Get Away with Murder</cite>, <cite>Overwatch</cite>, and so many more.
