<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>The methods used in this project draw on both qualitative and computational methods found in digital humanities, writing studies, writing/cultural analytics, and digital rhetoric. In Cushman, Falconer, and Juzwik’s (2018) editor’s note in their final issue as editors of the Research in the Teaching of English, they explore the constraints and affordances each type of research method offers; they address what is lost and gained in large corpus-based studies that might provide results that are generalizable, but do not have room for or might overlook the contextualized and identity-driven power that smaller-scale studies can have. By merging both the results from a large corpus analysis along with interview data from individual writers in the corpus, I describe fan uptakes and generic conventions using the interviewed fans’ rhetorical choices and generic actions, larger patterns in the genres based on computational analysis, and drawing comparisons between the computational analysis and the fans’ interviews.</p>
<h2>Research Questions</h2>
<p>This section describes how I unravel each research question using different methods and data. Later sections will further explore data collection and analytical methods more in depth.</p>
<p><a class="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#RQ1" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">RQ1</a> How can the resistance to or the reinforcement of cultural ideologies be traced in fanfiction genres?</p>
<div class="collapse" id="RQ1">
  <p>To answer this question, the data I use are uptake artifacts (Dryer, 2016), or the fanfiction texts themselves. I collected these fanfiction texts and metadata from <cite>Archive of Our Own</cite>, one of the current largest fanfiction publishing platforms in 2020 with over five million fanfictions published. I incorporate computational analysis methods to explore patterns across the fanfiction texts and their metadata. I examine tagging practices; linguistic patterns that revolve around power, normativity, and identity; and patterns that mirror or push against the original cultural material.</p>
  <p>The actual methods I implement are Natural Language Processing (NLP), word embedding models, network analysis, and data analytics based on fanfiction metadata. Documentation about the computational process can be found in the “<a href="{{ url_for('dis_computational_essays') }}">Computational Essays</a>" portion of the CFT. Results can be found across the CFT, but especially in the “<a href="{{ url_for('ffd_numbers') }}">Fandoms by Numbers</a>” section along with several of the “<a href="{{ url_for('bp_home') }}">Critical Fan Case Studies</a>."</p>

<p><a class="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#RQ2" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">RQ2</a>How can critical fandom practices be traced in fans’ uptakes of the original cultural material and fanfiction genres?</p>
<div class="collapse" id="RQ2">
<p>To answer this question, I frame questions around uptake enactment, or the action of responding to one genre with another expected genre (expectations determined contextually). In fan communities, there are expected fan uptakes within the community that can be traced through fanfiction, discussions, and other forms of fan writing. I specifically focus on fanfiction and fanfiction authors. I conduct six discourse-based interviews of fan authors who publish in the fanfiction corpus, asking them to reflect on particular choices as well as larger community expectations and the ideologies woven within the expectations. I choose writers who demonstrate critical fan uptakes in their fanfictions, whether this is in their tagging choices or the linguistic patterns in their texts.</p>
<p>I then qualitatively coded these interviews to capture patterns around the writing process, fans’ understandings of generic conventions and expected uptakes in fandoms, fans’ commentary on the canon text, and fans’ analysis of ideologies within fan communities. A full description of this process and the codes can be found in the "“"<a href="{{ url_for('interviews_qualitative_coding') }}">Qualitative Coding</a>" section of the CFT. Interview transcripts and further results can be found in the "<a href="{{ url_for('interviews') }}">Interviews with Critical Fans</a>" portion of the CFT.</p>

<p><a class="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#RQ3" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">RQ3</a>How can critical fan pedagogies be made useable and accessible for instructors and fans alike?</p>
<div class="collapse" id="RQ3">
  <p>The answer to this question resides more in the digital publication format of the dissertation, rather than specific data or analysis. The CFT is built to be an open-access, accessible, and public project for fans, scholars, and instructors alike. The CFT invites both  fans who are interested in implementing critical fan practices into their fandom participations and instructors who are interested in integrating critical fan pedagogies into their classrooms. Because of the digital publishing format, as I built the CFT, I implemented and thought through: user experience (UX), accessibility, documentation, search engine optimization (SEO), and sustainability.</p>

<h2>Data Justification</h2>
<p>In this section, I further explain why I chose particular methods and particular data, including why AO3 is important and why TLOk and GOT.</p>
<h3>Why AO3</h3>
<p>One of the largest and most popular websites to publish fanfiction is Archive of Our Own (AO3). Since 2009, when the AO3 beta first launched, over seven million works have been published. While there are other fan publishing websites out there such as Wattpad, I am focusing on AO3 for several reasons. First, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/4/11/18292419/archive-of-our-own-wins-hugo-award-best-related-work">AO3 received a Hugo Award for Best Related Work</a>, meaning every work published on AO3 received this Hugo Award (Romano, 2019). Second, AO3 belongs to the Organization of Transformative Works (OTW), a larger organization dedicated to protecting, preserving, and strengthening fan cultures. OTW has several projects, including <a href="https://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc">Transformative Works and Cultures</a> — a peer-reviewed open-access journal for fan scholars to share their research — and <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Main_Page">Fanlore</a>, a large fandom wiki. Third, AO3 is well-known for its fan-centered information system that was designed by and for fans (Dalton, 2012; Fiesler, Morrison, Bruckman, 2016).</p>
<p>	Fan studies scholars have studied sites like AO3 for various purposes, including examining the the structure of its information system as an example of feminist human-computer interaction (Fiesler, Morrison, & Buckman, 2016), tracing how fans use tagging practices to shape community (Dym, Brubaker, & Fiesler, 2018; Messina, 2019; Price & Robinson, 2021), and its relationship with academic scholarship through the OTW; in fact, several members on the current OTW board are academics—such as Kristina Busse—who write fan scholarship.</p>
<p>AO3 has “tag-wranglers,” who are volunteer fans who moderate and regulate metadata tags that authors choose for their fanfictions to make sure fics can be discovered. They preserve more unique tags, but regulate more popular tags, such as “Angst,” as well as relationship names and character names. For example, in GOT, the character tag “Missandei” may be used. However, because the tagging system for fan authors is free form with suggested tags, fans may misspell or use the wrong character tag, making their fanfic harder to discover. The tag wrangler’s job, then, is to go through tags and check for differences to make them more similar.</p>

<h3>Why Interviews?</h3>
<p>In the RTE Editor’s Introduction mentioned earlier, Cushman et al. (2018) raise a concern about large corpus-based research: “They provide fewer insights into the social workings of literacies in terms of power, value, structures, and ideologies. Equally important, then, is the deeply contextualized data presented in studies...which can really attend to the complexity of language and literacy in situ” (354). Their concerns reflect the feelings of caution many writing studies practitioners experience when quantitative and corpus-based analysis research is conducted. Writing studies centers the subject as well as the development, articulation, and expression of identity through literacy and learning practices. Numbers might be reflective of larger patterns, but often cannot represent individual, lived experiences. This is why qualitative inquiries are crucial; at their core, qualitative methods can make explicit the researcher’s positionality and interpretation as well as the situated contexts in which the research was conducted.</p>
<p>	Importantly, I wanted to incorporate fans’ voices and provide a space for them to share their perspectives, motivations, process, and analysis of the canon and fandom.</p>
<h2>AO3 Data Collection</h2>
<p>The data was collected from AO3 using a <a href="https://github.com/radiolarian/AO3Scraper">third party web scraping Python script created by Jingyi Li and @ssterman</a>; the data was collected with the permission of Transformative Works and Cultures, who I reached out to via email. Each fanfiction has its textual data, which is the actual story published, and metadata about the fanfiction. Metadata is data about data, or in this case the information about each fanfiction. The visualizations in the “<a href="{{ url_for('ffd_numbers') }}">Fandom by Numbers</a>” section, for example, are mainly using the metadata from TLoK and GoT fanfictions. Specifically, these visualizations incorporate these metadata that are chosen by each fanfiction author when they publish and/or revise their work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Published date: the publication date of the fanfiction,</li>
  <li>Relationship categories: the type of romantic relationship depicted based on the characters’ genders,</li>
  <li>Relationships: the actual characters in the relationship,</li>
  <li>Characters: the characters mentioned in the fanfic,</li>
  <li>Additional Tags: any additional tags selected by the authors, usually to signify genre, content, identity markers, or politics/ideologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data is not perfect, as there are some data (relationships, characters, and additional tags) that are not standardized. For example, fanfiction authors may have tagged Korra and Asami’s relationship as “Korra/Asami,” “Korra/Asami Sato,” or “Korrasami.” For the most part, AO3’s tag wrangles adjust these deviations to standardize the metadata, but not all the deviant data is changed. I also attempted to standardize some of the deviant data caught and combined the results.</p>
<p>The visualizations were created either using Python's Plotly or Tableau. Those created with Tableau are hosted on a Tableau server.
