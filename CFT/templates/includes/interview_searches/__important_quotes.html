    <h2>Important Quotes</h2>
    <ul>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>People write political theory when they write fan fic, like a lot of fan fic is political
          theory, a lot of fanfiction is political. People are like, "Oh..." When people talk
          about RWBY, the way they talk about the White Fang is the way they talk about radical
          politics. And I don't know if they realize it, but I always get really annoyed, because
          this is like bad political theory. It's very normal American political theory, but
          it's also bad. It's very much like, "Oh, there's no justification for violence," it's
          like, "I don't agree." When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like...
          There's a study I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about
          things you don't convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that
          I'm in that place, arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
          context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
          very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
          you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
          original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
          through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
          and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
          with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
          get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
          you. I was coming into my own politically, I was becoming my own political individual
          in a way I hadn't been before. Like I had politics, but this is around the time that
          I'm really radicalized, and just me engaging with those contexts.</li>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
          I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
          but it felt more like a nod than a full  There are things I don't like about it, but
          I like it as a little bit of text. It's there in the text, it was one of those things
          that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love feeling represented." So I wrote that. I chose
          the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading a...
          I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
          different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
          in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
          and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
          looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>but this is what I was doing with my life. I was on my way to running a queer resource
          center at a college, so I was doing the work of feeling the political implications
          of things in the world. And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about
          is to write about... Not just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia,
          not just homophobia, but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because
          this was the thing that was radicalizing me, [inaudible] is vile, because... And it
          was about violence, so I don't just mean violence as a method of resistance, I mean
          violence as a thing that people survive. Because that's what's radicalizing me at
          the time. And so I felt the need to wake up that in a sense.</li>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I was under the impression, reading or engaging with this text, I came away with
          this feeling like the Northern Water Tribe is somewhat... very different from the
          rest of the world, and there are ways that it plays as... I don't know if it was textual
          or sort of fan-driven more, but I remember coming away with this feeling that there
          is a marginalized subjectivity in the Northern Water Tribe. And so telling this story
          about difference in culture, and we'll get to... I'll get to Korra's upbringing a
          little bit later, because you're going to ask about 10 minutes later about Korra's
          upbringing. But I want to... Basically that I think Korra's upbringing is particularly
          reflective of that culture, yeah. I come away from Korra feeling like, "This is a
          gender thing going on." I don't buy that there's not homophobia in a world with gender
          in the like weird way that... In ways that still reflect our I think gender and homophobia
          [inaudible 00:21:13], the way that we have a sense of gender. Big, capital G Gender.
          And so I thought like, "What does it mean to have culture in the context of... What
          does it mean to be a cosmopolitan city where... There's both a degree of marginalization
          for like the Northern Water Tribe closing... Not so much that rules that are really
          intended to enforce gender norms are going to be there. And also to be like, "Yeah,
          there's probably a different understanding of gender in context," yeah.</li>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was trying to write a story that engaged with trauma and felt authentic and didn't
          make trauma seem like the end of the world. Because the binary that's in a lot of
          literature is either like, "Oh, you either overcame trauma, or you are doomed to misery
          forever." And I was trying to find some middle ground, trying to tell a story that
          felt authentic. Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma
          after time, because her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to
          death as a vulnerability. Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's
          a place that engagement is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's
          an ordeal for Korra to dress herself. I wanted to tell a story about connection. And
          I wanted to make it clear that when I'm telling the story, I think that even [inaudible
          00:26:39] understands that it's not really about romance as much as it is about feeling
          connected in a genuine way to people, that that central theme, building a life worth
          living after injury, or after trauma, is finding an authentic realtionship with people.
          And so Asami plays that role, being a person to whom Korra wants to relate, is thrilled
          to relate, is not scared, or she is a little bit scared to relate, but is she scared
          to relate in the way that she's scared to relate to other people.</li>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
          progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
          man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
          and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
          said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
          understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
          woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
          This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
          institution itself.</li>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>In the context of this piece, a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois
          radical is that I'm not going to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really
          have a sense of class politics at the time, or have the beginnings of that study.
          That's only beginning to be born So to me, Hiroshi's both a man that would destroy
          his children for the things he believes, and in some sense for his own power. But
          also a man who genuinely is providing aid and comfort and resources for fighting for
          what he views as liberation, and that liberation's probably genuine at some level.
          I think it's fair to say that there is a political bender-like supremacy at the beginning.
          I mean there is, we know there's a bender supremacy at the beginning of Legend of
          Korra. And so that's how I understand Hiroshi.</li>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
          a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
          but it's good. Also I think it's when fiction ends, it does draw people who are like,
          "Oh, I want to write more on this subject, I want to play with these concepts again."
          There's also a distinct un-ended-ness I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration
          is limited, is kind of bad. But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where
          it's like, they just want to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did
          see them agree, yeah I want to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this,
          it's healthy. I love that! I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage
          with.[inaudible 00:47:08] what are other ways we can imagine it? And that creates
          fanon, which means you get this whole long space of people being like, "Oh yeah, I
          am writing about this content of fanon in this alternate universe, I'm going to write
          a piece about a radio show It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of
          [inaudible 00:47:39], some of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion
          that comes out of that. So I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and
          I think that it's liberating for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
          love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
          stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
          of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
          of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
          "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
          who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
          of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yes. I think my most recent published fan fiction is a
          Percy Weasley, second person point of view, post canon. In which he is attempting
          to
          basically restructure his society by running on a platform of big structural change.
          Which might sound vaguely familiar.  But it was, I
          think, mostly due to the kind of deep rage that I was feeling over the entire
          Democratic Primaries over the past couple of months. And almost the past year.
          In which everything felt very much like a lot of talk, and not a lot of doing.
          And at some point, you need some catharsis. And kind of putting it out into
          fiction and seeing something changing. Or, not even seeing something changing.
          But seeing people trying to effect change, and willing to fight for that change
          felt very important to me. And basically that entire fanfic is kind of born out
          of that seething, massive, "I want to see something happening."
          And I will see it happen in fiction, if not in reality. was talking about that, and
          I felt like
          that was a really fascinating look into that psyche. And seeing how Fleabag and the
          Priest would meet up. And how they would be after having separated for 20, 30 years,
          coming back to see each other after they have had full lives apart, but somehow
          still wanting something more. Which, I think, it's definitely, kind of, for me, I
          am
          not old enough to be discussing 50 year old, 60 year old life plans. But my life
          path has never been very straight, or what I felt that it would be. Because when I
          was, what? 15, I probably thought I'd be an engineer. And then after that I thought
          I'd be a doctor. And then, suddenly, now I'm a lawyer. And I thought I'd be in the
          U.S., and I'm in India. And it's a very wildly divergent and strange life path for
          me. And that's only been over, what? 10 years, 10, 15 years. And I can't even
          imagine how that would be over 20, 30 years. And identifying that desire for home,
          and wanting people to be that. As opposed to a given area, or a given job, or
          anything like that, felt very poignant to me at that particular point in
          time. So, that was one fic that I was relatively and very
          proud of. To be honest.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I chose to make it Desi because I am Desi. and I wanted
          to experience it. And if you're just starting from scratch, then it's
          difficult to create why two people would hate each other so much. I mean, you need
          to have that religious, and
          cultural, and those barriers in order for that to
          happen. So, I mean, I think the
          choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
          setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
          trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
          for it.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it was football RPF
          (real person fic) fanfiction. Which was very interesting, because I think it was
          just after the 2018 World Cup. And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that
          used second person point of
          view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
          you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
          of
          view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
          what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
          more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person. And that also came
          across to a lot of readers, is what
          they were telling me, at least. Because they felt like there was a lot more gravitas
          to the entire fic that you wouldn't see in a lot of my other
          fanfics.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that for
          the actual research it was not so much that I did it for this particular fanfic, as
          it was more that I love that era a lot. So, I had tended to research it before, as
          well. So, I had a lot of information that I kind of knew in colloquial terms. But
          I did
          not remember the exact way that he had died, so then I kind of went searching for
          that. And then, I mean, from there it kind of spiraled into researching other things
          and kind of reading up more about Akbar and more about Jodhaa. And I'm an avid
          research. I mean, that's what I do now. And then, of course, you have the Targaryen
          colors, which are black, which are mourning colors according to the Western
          culture. And all of it kind of comes together. And, of course,
          Rajput culture is known for its red, its vibrant, blood red. And obviously, that's
          a
          Targaryen color. And all of this kind of, to me, I mean, I think that's what
          a lot of fanficiton is, at least. It's taking things that are already there and kind
          of pooling them together. And sometimes you have amazing coincidences that people
          just don't think about. And it's about exploiting those coincidences, and making
          them sound like, "Oh, I'm so brilliant. I actually had thought about it
          beforehand." Where I
          just didn't translate them into Rajput or Hindi words. Because I just use
          whatever I knew, because I speak Kannada at home. And that's
          another language entirely. And I was just running out of time, and I said, "You know
          what? No, I'll just handle it myself. And not translate it, and hope that nobody
          minds. I think a lot of the research and a lot of the material
          was just about identifying and pulling disparate ideas together that I knew.
          From either my own culture because, of course,
          this is partially my own culture. And also, the historical
          details of [inaudible 00:27:49]. And I think that was what
          was very important to me, especially in this story, was puling it all together so
          that there weren't any open endings. And the research really, somehow, it helped in
          pulling that together.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I honestly expected nobody to do
          that. It's good to see that people are just as interested in a lot of it, in this
          stuff. You know? I think that the
          thing I wanted to keep in mind was that I was doing the research, but I was also not
          putting as much research into it as I probably should have if I wanted to make it
          historical fiction. I was literally
          just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
          as
          South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
          Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it. And that was one thing I
          wanted to be clear about.
          Because, yes, it was research. But I think I wanted to keep to the spirit of the
          movie, as well as the spirit of the A Song of Ice and Fire canon. But when I was making
          the
          actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
          actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
          identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
          identify. But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
          and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
          that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
          ideas from. Just building that list kind of helps me know where and how
          I'm getting the material, and the assumptions that I've made throughout the fanfic.
          And, therefore, helps make it easier to kind of discuss it later, I think. I was really
          worried about how it
          would be perceived by the fandom, how it would be received by people even outside
          of
          the fandom. Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
          be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner. So, that was one of the
          primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
          sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
          clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
          Jon is raised a Targaryen. And it is an angsty fic. It's not like a comedy, there
          is angst.
          And it's one of the major points of the entire fanfic. And the reason I did the Jodhaa
          Akbar tag was actually
          because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
          other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
          fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
          particular tag. I mean, this fic is obviously
          dramatized and all that. But the essential part of it is that both of them have
          this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
          that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
          see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
          very difficult way of going through life. And it's not
          necessarily a happy life that you lead when you have that kind of a
          mentality.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
          I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
          make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
          heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
          fandoms. And I think that's probably because we don't have one
          main character and one side character that's like the sidekick to the main
          character, both of them being male. You don't have that here.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I hate that I did it, but I did real-person
          fanfiction for Paramore. Thinking of it now, it's always like, "God, that's not
          good. I shouldn't have done it, but here we are." And from those three, you can see
          that they have
          very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
          queer
          characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
          go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
          their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
          situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I like that a lot of people, I still get comments
          occasionally that are, "I've just gone through this whole thing," and you can do
          that. Even though it's 400 chapters, it's book-length. It's like a
          normal book length. It's easily digestible, and each thing's its own thing, so if
          you want to stop it and come back to it later, you can. People do usually, if you're
          feeling a specific mood, and go find that specific one and just go through a couple
          of those. I like that it's sort of, you don't have to have a super amount of
          emotional investment in it, like super long, 10-chapter fics that are 100,000
          words. Like yes, it's very good. I enjoy it. But sometimes, I'm just in
          the mood for something light and I like that I can provide that for people who want
          that. I also like that you can sort of see a progression of
          how I wrote them and how my own skills have maybe, hopefully developed. And even
          just, it did end up being four years' worth of time so it was, when I think I started
          it, Korrasami hadn't
          been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
          And maybe, I think,
          during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
          different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
          strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I'm
          very much a person who believes in, if you can't say it in like two words
          then you probably shouldn't. So, I like to have it, what
          is this thing? And that's it. I like to be able to say, "This is what it's going to
          be," and it doesn't necessarily need to be more complicated than that. I know a lot
          of people like to have full sentences, and
          get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
          distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
          be
          able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
          somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
          something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
          looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
          and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
          is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
          don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
          came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
          into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
          ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that. "Okay, well, let's just do Korra next,"
          because I was pretty sure
          that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
          of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
          of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
          watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it. I was very
          much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
          and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
          style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality. And
          then, just
          seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
          once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
          not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
          the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
          there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
          Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
          super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
          of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
          relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
          should take five steps back, and let's just
          focus on these two.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
          only get a certain amount of them in canon. So, it's kind of just how I always
          imagined her parents were just going to always be there for her. And we do see that
          in season three, where she's immediately going to bat for them and each
          other. So, at the same time,
          it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
          since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
          until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
          a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
          decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
          this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
          case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
          Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
          bit. So, I just tried to stay true to that, I guess, in some
          regard, as far as her relationship went.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
          serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
          just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
          things that made me super uncomfortable. And it's also, given the
          audience, this is considered a family show. So, I realized over time that maybe I
          don't have to write that. If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
          it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
          press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
          slaves is super ... I didn't want to
          contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
          [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
          more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
          been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
          thing.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Oh,
          the easy answer is sexism,
          because everyone sees the main heroine next to a cute boy and decides, "That's
          good. I'm going to do that," without maybe necessarily putting much more thought
          into it. Obviously, there's always going to be people who say,
          "I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
          care whether or not they necessarily gel." I'm sure there's
          people ... I feel like I went back a million years ago and looked at the first
          Korrasami fics, just out of curiosity, to see when they were published, and I'm sure
          that they were like episode one, because it's just what people do, and it's great.
          Ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon. So, it was there,
          but
          it's not surprising that a lot of people who aren't looking for it don't go and see
          it. A lot of
          straight people I know will look at a lot of these relationships and say, "Oh,
          that came from nowhere."</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>At the end of season three, we saw that development and
          we saw, especially during Korra's fight with Zaheer, Asami looked the most scared
          out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her
          recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, "That's a little gayer than it maybe
          should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
          of people took that and decided to go with it, especially since
          the relationship was [inaudible 01:00:21], whether or not ...
          Again, and at that time, we didn't know the writer's intention, so it was just
          everybody, or at least Korrasami fans, picking
          up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
          so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
          happen."</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
          was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
          possible love interests. Tahno was just a bully that people decide ... I don't
          understand why people like that, but people do. So, we spend four seasons developing
          Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
          lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
          out  immediately after
          the season finale aired, everyone was sort of unsure like, "This is canon, right?
          This is canon. That's what this looks
          like," "Korrasami's canon. That's
          what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
          up to that point, there really hadn't been
          a whole lot of huge representation for female ships. So, these big cartoons that are
          for kids are doing more
          for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
          kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
          much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust." So, to
          see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
          god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
          have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And
          then there was a bit of a lull until my delving into the Indian forums. And there
          we
          would do the meta analysis and satirical writings and so on.  Actually, I completely
          forgot, there was a period where I
          would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because I don't do that
          anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment with writing
          and being critical of source materials and so on. I guess you can say it was a nudge
          to move from passive
          consumption to active consumption.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I am
          currently in the Supergirl fandom, which has been a mess. I'm saying that
          nicely. I think it was more that it was
          very books for me because I
          grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on South America but as socially, politically
          part of the Caribbean, so most of the content that we were consuming was either
          shows from the US or whatever, maybe European shows might have filtered through,
          and that also was the case for the books that we were reading. And while it was
          the case within school for us to consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to
          read Caribbean literature as a person on my own. So it was just discovering a collection
          of books in my own home from my aunt and my mother and so on, their teachers.
          And my aunt in particular,
          she teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
          them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
          were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
          know. I guess it comes back to not knowing what you're missing
          until you finally have it. So when I first read texts were people were actually talking
          about foods that I
          would eat or where people were living in communities like mine, where people
          spoke that way that I spoke, et cetera.
          Because even though I speak, let's say, like this,
          how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back home, it's a
          little different even though ... So, my particular country, we speak English,
          but it's a particular kind of English. So just seeing that in
          text and then realizing that the fantasies and so on that I was consuming were ...
          I
          don't know, it had these strange things that just didn't quite compute with where
          I
          was living. That's where it really clicked for me. And from that point onward, I
          think that's where I began to see it in everything else. The biggest shift didn't
          really come until I moved to the US,
          because back home I
          was part of the majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing
          yourself in other ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in
          the news as a politician, et cetera. But here it was a completely different
          ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I was on Twitter casually
          scrolling through something, and someone from back home happened to mention how the
          finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background and
          the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
          that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
          Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
          I
          could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
          been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
          how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way. But also the
          fics I had read after the show had finished
          seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ... Obviously, it was a
          really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had happened in the gap
          years that they hadn't shown us for Korra. I kind of wanted to see
          that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular, and this was surprising
          for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I never really remember to
          think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like there was this big gap
          available to us for exploration.  So I kind
          of wanted to explore that and see how Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for
          me I like to see how the characters are responding to what's happening to them
          rather than having the plot happen to them, and with Asami there was just so much
          room to do that.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>For this
          particular fic, I think it was just the imagery. I was really trying to grasp
          something that in some ways is so intangible. I was trying so hard to get just that
          feeling of desolation and aching. But the metaphor itself of the Marching Ants, it
          was
          this way of articulating the anxiety that comes along with that. So I think it just
          came back
          to capturing that, the imagery of it, the tone of the chapter, the voice of it
          because, at least to me, it works really hard to put us in Asami's shoes and make
          us
          experience it exactly as she's experiencing it.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess
          the sensation of ants ... I come from an area where you commonly come into contact
          with animals and so on, so I'm familiar with the actual physical reality of ants
          crawling across your skin, and there's a way that it feels. It's like a sort of
          weird, prickling sensation that is very disconcerting, and I guess I wanted to
          translate that into how the story reflects Asami's own experience with whatever
          she's feeling. And that imagery just seemed to click with that, just the experience
          of having something under your skin and on your skin, even if you can't quite
          articulate what it is.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> It has less to do with fandom
          itself and more to do with the external world. And even now it's, I guess it's ...
          I
          don't know. I think it just seemed
          like the safer option at the time.  But the more time I've
          spent in that part of fandom, the less I guess I've cared about how it's read or
          whatever it is. But at the time, it just seemed wiser, particularly if I was having
          others who may not ... Because fan works and original work for me are on the same
          level, and so I'm not concerned, I guess, with people reading it for ... people
          reading it and not seeing a difference in quality, but rather how they experience
          the content. And so I think I was still considering who the audience would
          be.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it's just existing
          personally as a marginalized person. The way that that storyline was handled in LOK,
          I think I wasn't quite comfortable with it, just the very idea of the movement
          disappearing because of one man's end. It seems so unrealistic because there was a
          real situation with inequality there. Because we see that the world has adapted to
          cater for benders, and we don't quite know non-benders are faring in that world,
          what kind of opportunities they're having. And based on the conflict that the show
          raised, it was clear that non-benders were in a position where they weren't having
          ends meet or they weren't getting the jobs that they hoped to get. So both
          as a black person and as a woman, it was just important for me to recognize that
          in text and get around to exploring what that might have meant for other
          characters who weren't within the Circle of the Avatar and had powerful
          connections. The universe raises really
          interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
          we
          kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
          thing about fandom and fan
          fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that either there
          wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important enough to
          explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always in the
          forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the world," not
          just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
          through.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular, I think it's fascinating
          that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all these really powerful girl
          and women characters who were, for the most part, respected, at least in later
          years. Because when we first meet the Avatar world, we know
          that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all this power, she's in this
          position where she could eventually have the throne, she isn't respected by her own
          father. And I
          think I'd actually forgotten about this until someone else had written it in their
          own fan fiction, which is part of what's so fun about reading fan fiction. There are
          all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on right away, but someone else mentions
          it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the world and look at it from a different
          angle. But even Katara in the
          beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use waterbending beyond
          healing, and she goes on to become one of the greatest
          waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have this really
          powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends someone who is,
          up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more ruthless and so
          forth. So it was interesting to see all
          these female characters get to be complex and powerful and not have that held
          against them, unless you count Azula and how that ended for
          her.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think for that
          particular story I had to remind myself, especially because I had read so many fan
          fictions where this was ... And I know it's understandable, but I kind find it a
          flaw for some people. Just keeping the world in focus. Because there is this thing
          in fan fiction where we assume that all people who are
          accessing it are familiar with the text. And while that is often common when we want
          it to function beyond that world to have relevance in other ways, I think for me
          personally it's important to integrate more parts of the world, of the
          universe. For me, it was just
          reminding myself that, even though I'm writing something where there are people who
          are familiar with the text, it's also important to fill in the blanks
          sometimes.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think, and I'll probably go with my own fandom experiences,
          it just comes back to how the world is constructed externally. So just even the
          idea of imagining inside of what was placed before us, it takes a special kind
          of familiarity with the boarders of the world to imagine a world that is
          different from what is presented to you. At the time, I don't know, it was just that
          Korra
          and Mako were what was the norm. And so I think it made sense for some people to
          only be able to see that happening. I mean, I didn't see the possibility of
          Korrasami until the very end. But when I circled back around
          after having spent about several months reading several fan fictions</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But yeah, I just,
          spending so much time reading so much fan fiction from LOK and then branching
          out into Steven Universe and moving from Steven Universe into Supergirl, there
          was just more of an interaction with another side of fandom, the slash side of
          fandom. I don't know. I think you have to be integrated with others who are
          looking for more than what's presented, looking for more than what's norm,
          what's the acceptable way of telling a story of any kind of relationship really.
          Because even when you talk
          about what characters are bound to get more attention and more interesting and
          so on and so forth, when you look at fandom in general you'll find that when
          those characters are black or just generally a person of color in comparison to
          a character being white, that people are least particular when the fandom's
          dominated by white faces and so forth. They are more likely to explore those
          characters and to humanize them and to want to get to know them better, while
          other characters and what their hopes and dreams and ideas might be for the
          world are pushed to the side.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't know. I'm not surprised. Plus the allocishets tend to dominate fandom in
          general, so it made sense that they would sort of own the sandbox and everyone
          else should be playing to the side.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I
          think it may have come back to that as well, a combination of both familiarity with
          visual cues in storytelling, both a tendency to read closer in text in general,
          whether it's literature or visual media, as well as having familiarized yourself
          with another community. I'm always on
          the fence sometimes when I'm talking about how people are seeing or not seeing
          certain things. Because even with my current fandom, it's like half the people
          are saying that we're delusional or creating things where there aren't things.
          And then other times you see these exact phenomena occurring in cishet
          media.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I'm like, "In what
          world am I supposed to view this as platonic? I mean, I know I was raised in a pretty
          fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing here things
          that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
          00:58:53] people." So that's when I became a
          believer. And the longer I watched the show, the more it seemed to grow. And you could
          tell, from a fandom perspective, some people
          who are cishet won't be able to speak to this, but you could
          tell that the writer's room was split in how they were portraying the characters
          because I think they got
          uncomfortable with how fandom was growing so rapidly and intensely around these
          two characters, even to the
          point where they used the black character as a wedge between
          them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
          in that show. </li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
          to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
          bi-sexual. I used it sort of as a tool in some fan fics to work
          through ideas or feelings that I'd had and didn't know how to properly verbalize
          yet. I was putting them on paper, using another
          character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
          where I felt I was kind of safe to do so. I didn't always
          publish all of them, but the one that you contacted me over, I did,
          obviously.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
          show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
          just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
          not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
          female-female relationships as well, because a lot of the media already does a lot
          of
          the male-female exploration. And a lot of the purpose of fandom
          is to sort of explore beyond what we're just given.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
          Jamie and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
          because obviously they wouldn't be having as
          much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
          considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
          day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
          from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
          versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
          wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
          identity. But there would definitely be some push
          back, but how would that change based on the setting?
          I made her a little bit more comfortable in
          her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
          shoulder for Jaime
          who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
          well.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to actually put some Game
          of Thrones content on those tags to begin with because back when I was writing it,
          there wasn't a lot really going for it. LGBT fan fics, yeah sure, but
          gender fluid and gender
          related things, it wasn't really there. While I do ship them together romantically,
          I
          wanted to write something that also reflected that you could do like a very intimate
          moment without bring sex into it as well. I feel for them, a lot of their fics also
          had a lot of like Jaime
          being the man and Brienne finally being able to let her guard
          down. It's
          something that I wanted to, again, wanted to bring into a fan fic to kind of make
          it
          more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and
          wondering the same thing. Like, where is this content that
          should be out there because it's in the books and why is no one taking this up and
          writing about it?</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think I would want to go
          more into maybe tagging some of the triggers maybe now a days because back then
          there wasn't as much of a discussion around it. Now a days, you have more of a
          discussion around what bigger tags to put in to help people avoid it for instance.
          Now that AO3 has updated its tagging system to include and exclude.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
          actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
          how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
          how she had gotten to living with Jaime. I just find their relationship in
          canon to be so interesting because it was one of
          the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
          pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
          surprised. Brienne was what a lot of
          these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
          places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
          and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
          of her issues with not being able
          to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
          heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
          always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
          gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable There's a lot
          of, again, fan fic already out there of
          them being intimate, but it was all
          very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
          vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
          I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
          own instead.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
          guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
          to when I came out to them.
          I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
          of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
          having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
          leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
          little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime I wanted to kind of write
          it as like a self-fulfilling
          fantasy as well as like how I would have pictured them actually going through
          it.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That would have been a good way to end it, not, we're going to hug
          each other and we're going to let some rocks fall. I had some really bad, some
          really heated discussions with a friend on my dashboard on Twitter. We just did that,
          like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
          and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
          interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
          dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
          front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
          interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
          not try and put this away. Yeah, it was a whole mess. People
          came out in droves, angry for different reasons.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I knew everything that was going to
          happen until about Season Four. And was perfectly happy with it, really wasn't
          paying any attention. So, right when about Season
          Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
          Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
          no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
          brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
          thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
          wrote a Game of Thrones fan fiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
          series, the first one.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
          know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Dr. Who episodes is Turn Left. And
          it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
          What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
          And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
          and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
          the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
          that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
          world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
          would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
          maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
          how I got into that.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I literally got up off the couch and walked away when
          she got beheaded. I was very upset. It pissed me
          off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
          slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
          did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
          white women. That was very, very frustrating and irritating to
          me. So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
          of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
          That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yes. She's a weird character. Mostly she seems to almost
          be absent from things. She's window dressing. She's there, she doesn't speak, or she
          speaks, it's one or two sentences in the entire fic. And it's frustrating because
          once again in the book, she's such a pivotal character. And so, you get those fics
          where she
          either has none of those, she's either not there, or she has really none of those
          attributes. She's kind of just a yes person. Yes, Khaleesi, no Khaleesi, yes my
          queen. That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
          delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
          Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
          away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
          one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
          fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
          of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
          if I was a former slave. The one thing I
          would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
          in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
          into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
          anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
          like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fan fiction. She's really an
          underused character.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
          thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
          in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
          and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
          unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
          me
          try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
          There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
          improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful. The
          "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
          People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
          right there." So I had the "What if." Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
          The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
          right. Ratings may change, warnings may change, series,
          spoilers, all those kind of speak for themselves, just to let you know that okay,
          once again, this isn't static. This is something that changes story by story. Some
          of them may be Gen, some of them, I haven't written one yet, but some of them may
          be
          adult in the future. Some of them may have a lot of violence in them, so just be
          aware. Don't ever come back to this fic and think, "This is what it is." Because
          that's not it. I think my
          characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
          "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
          it may be out of character." Like I said, new fandoms are hard because they
          are. I have a lot of Game of Thrones stuff on the cutting
          room floor, before I decided what to actually post. And there is about 20 other
          drabbles for the one series that haven't made it yet, because I'm one of those
          writers. Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
          that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that Alternate universe, canon
          divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
          want to get blasted on that one. Missandei deserved
          better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
          they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
          would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23]. Fluff and angst, I
          cannot write straight fluff. I'm incapable. You have to have pain with your
          pleasure. I can't do it.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
          agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
          dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
          that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
          Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
          we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
          that was a little irritating to me. So I wanted
          her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
          supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
          that. I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
          beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
          thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Sansa is really presented as one of those girls with her
          head in the clouds. She's definitely not a Margaery Tyrell. She was definitely never
          really prepared for court
          life. She has a view of it that is heavily skewed by stories of
          [inaudible 00:33:28] of these wonderful knights in their shining armor, these
          lovely ladies who are just ethereal in their beauty, everything being wrapped up
          in a bow, happily ever after. Maybe something happens, but someone's always
          rescued. And through the series, that kind of gets torn away
          from her bit by bit. The Prince Charming that she thought was a Prince Charming is
          definitely not. There's no one comes to save her. Her brother's more interested in
          being a king than coming to rescue her from the tower, and the monsters inside it.
          So really, Sansa's really forced to grow up,
          and she's really forced to see all these stories as exactly what they are.
          They're just stories. They're empty stories to make children
          happy. So when she's thinking back on this, she's thinking more of the scarier
          stories that maybe she didn't want to listen to. What I was afraid of, I should never
          have
          been afraid of, what I wanted was the thing I should have been worried about.
          She's really kind of flipped the script in her own mind. And
          she's standing amongst these wolves, and it's like before, she would have been
          terrified. She would have been cowering. And now she realizes, this is where I need
          to be. This is where it's at.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
          Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
          without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
          something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
          times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
          I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
          to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
          think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
          sentiment.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
          seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
          woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
          anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
          back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
          Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
          slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
          she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
          jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
          great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
          I've seen it before.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually
          had one troll who just wrote, "Fuck you, you bastard." And I was like, yes. I was
          just like, "Whoa. Okay. I'm sorry you're having such a bad day. Go have a mimosa.
          Just don't take it out on me." But
          there are just people who are just nasty. In all the fandoms I've been in, it
          thankfully hasn't happened to me yet, and I've actually had people defend me in
          comments. They're just like, "Get that shit out of here." I'm like, "Okay, thank you
          for being nice." But it seems the Game of Throne fandoms can get real violent. They
          get real virulent with their hatred in the comments section. I can't muster that
          kind of hatred. If I don't like something, I just click off of it. I don't get the
          hate.</li>
