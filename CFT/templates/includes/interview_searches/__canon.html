<ul>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
      have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
      in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
      context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
      very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
      you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
      original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
      through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
      and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
      with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
      get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
      you.</li>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
      I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
      already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
      weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
      I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
      but it felt more like a nod than a full</li>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
      there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
      feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
      a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
      different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
      in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
      and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
      looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political
      institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family
      institutions. My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community
      college is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of
      people that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't
      talk about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
      that was the only source of information.</li>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
      a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
      but it's good.</li>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad.
      But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want
      to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want
      to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that!
      I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.[inaudible 00:47:08]
      what are other ways we can imagine it?</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So then I realized that Jodhaa Akbar, which is
      definitely a Desi film, had a wonderful set of characters that was definitely
      angsty, but had a wonderfully happy ending. And allowed me to write about something
      that was kind of dear to my heart as well. Because it was a Desi film. It was one
      representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
      those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
      to bridge them. Because you have to. Because it's not just
      about love, or it's not just about anything. It's about your pride, it's about your
      family's livelihood. All of those kind of come together, you have to do it. You
      don't want to, but, somehow, you have to. I think it's that gritting of your teeth,
      and getting on with life that kind of really draws me in.</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean that I just don't think I relate to him at the
      same extent that I relate to Sansa.</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think if you look at A Song of Ice and Fire, technically,
      more than Game of Thrones, you
      actually get more of a cultural tension due to just the difference between the
      North and the South. And all of that. And I do think that George R. R. Martin
      has kind of perpetuated the idea, simply because he is English. So, the whole
      idea that in England, where Northerners are tougher and everything than
      Southerners. And I don't know anything more about it. But I think that's kind of
      one of the underlying and unconscious biases within the framework of the
      canon.</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, obviously, Season Eight was terrible.
      That was a given. And the ending did not do anyone any favors.</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And second of all, the actual TV show was not doing itself any
      favors. </li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah, I mean, I think
      when I was first getting into the fandom,
      one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
      strong. And it's true to a great extent. But I think what's
      even more fascinating to me, is how a lot of them tend to show that strength in so
      many different ways. Like, you have Sansa, who
      is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
      of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
      conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
      world. And then you have people like Margaery Tyrell and Cersei
      Lannister,</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I actually do remember how unhappy people were that Sansa didn't
      end with a love interest at the end of Season Eight.</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I
      think it's just a relief to see how... Because to me, it's almost like a moment of
      such growth, is what I felt, when I felt Sansa. Because when you're young,
      [inaudible 01:20:56]. You want the perfect marriage, and
      the perfect husband, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't mean that
      you'll necessarily get it. And to me, at least, growing up is balancing those
      childhood desires, and those childhood needs with whatever you learn as you grow up.
      And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
      child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
      sure that nobody hurt her.</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think
      there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
      liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
      everything.</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, obviously, there's a ton of other problems. How [inaudible
      01:21:42] Daenerys, and Cersei, and Jaime. And a number of other characters.</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I could understand why people felt unhappy about it. But at the same time, I
      think you're beating on the wrong bush here. There's a lot of other problems to deal
      with within this fandom. And within this canon that we don't particularly need as
      much as you're putting into it.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
      very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
      queer
      characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
      go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
      their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
      situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
      don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
      came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
      into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
      ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Okay, well, let's just do Korra next," because I was pretty sure
      that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
      of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
      of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
      watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I was very much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
      and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
      style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
      seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
      once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
      not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
      the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
      there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
      </li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
      super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
      of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
      relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
      should take five steps back, and let's just
      focus on these two.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> That was
      Christmas break, but my grandma was staying over for the weekend, so I had to watch
      it silently at like midnight, and freak out quietly. As soon as Asami showed up on
      the screen, I must have lost
      it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
      happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I loved that. Even if, and I think
      once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
      maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
      to see
      that, but I liked that they
      weren't immediate, for the most part.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
      it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
      since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
      until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
      a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
      decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
      this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
      case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
      Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
      bit.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
      was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
      possible love interests.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, we spend four seasons developing
      Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
      lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
      out</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
      see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
      god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
      have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it was also good that
      nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
      communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
      white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
      frankly.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
      watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
      because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
      and so on.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At the time that the
      show was airing, it
      was kind of taboo for divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare
      for a widower to be portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife
      that he had lost, so it was a combination of really interesting
      things.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And because
      I grew up in a country where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian
      content was part of our regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened,
      so it shaped what I was interested in.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I think with Twilight
      it was just that phase where you finally find a story that speaks to you, even if
      you kind of hate it when you look back at it when you're older. But at the time, how
      Bella was written both as someone who was
      insular and chooses to form or has a small community and so forth and deals with
      depression or whatever it is, it just seemed to be something
      that I could relate to.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it was more that it was
      very books for me because I
      grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on South America but as socially, politically
      part of the Caribbean, so most of the content that we were consuming was either
      shows from the US or whatever, maybe European shows might have filtered through,
      and that also was the case for the books that we were reading. And while it was
      the case within school for us to consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to
      read Caribbean literature as a person on my own.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So it was just discovering a collection
      of books in my own home from my aunt and my mother and so on, their teachers.
      And my aunt in particular,
      she teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
      them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
      were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
      know. I guess it comes back to not knowing what you're missing
      until you finally have it. So when I first read texts were people were actually talking
      about foods that I
      would eat or where people were living in communities like mine, where people
      spoke that way that I spoke, et cetera.
      Because even though I speak, let's say, like this,
      how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back home, it's a
      little different even though ... So, my particular country, we speak English,
      but it's a particular kind of English. So just seeing that in
      text and then realizing that the fantasies and so on that I was consuming were ...
      I
      don't know, it had these strange things that just didn't quite compute with where
      I
      was living. That's where it really clicked for me. And from that point onward, I
      think that's where I began to see it in everything else. The biggest shift didn't
      really come until I moved to the US,
      because back home I
      was part of the majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing
      yourself in other ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in
      the news as a politician, et cetera. But here it was a completely different
      ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I was on Twitter casually
      scrolling through something, and someone from back home happened to mention how the
      finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background and
      the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
      that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
      Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
      I
      could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
      been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
      how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
      came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
      that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think in the first two
      books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I guess her experiences
      are fantastical in a sense.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It was sort of ... To me, it
      was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is this
      all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having this
      really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once had,
      and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to deal
      with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so forth.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't know, it just ... There may have been other works of
      fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that was when Korra
      just seemed more human.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korra
      gets to her lowest point.  The implication is
      that she's about to jump off a cliff. But we don't really get to dwell in the
      true feeling of that moment, the have to fix it immediately because of the idea
      that the show may never get to come back to this point, so we don't get to
      actually see what that means for her.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>we see Korra actual deal, for more than one
      episode, with how she's effected by these things, and to me that was
      different.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>You
      actually get to see an avatar. And yes, Aang did deal with this too, but it's ...
      I
      don't know. It's just different for me. Deal
      with PTSD and depression and just all these changing things. It
      was interesting.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>everyone has seen someone who they think is all-powerful and
      infallible, invulnerable to an extent, be ... I don't want to say broken, but be injured
      in a really drastic way and them not
      being able to do anything much to help with her recovery in concrete
      ways.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it's just existing
      personally as a marginalized person. The way that that storyline was handled in LOK,
      I think I wasn't quite comfortable with it, just the very idea of the movement
      disappearing because of one man's end. It seems so unrealistic because there was a
      real situation with inequality there. Because we see that the world has adapted to
      cater for benders, and we don't quite know non-benders are faring in that world,
      what kind of opportunities they're having. And based on the conflict that the show
      raised, it was clear that non-benders were in a position where they weren't having
      ends meet or they weren't getting the jobs that they hoped to get.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
      interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
      we
      kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
      thing about fandom and fan
      fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that either there
      wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important enough to
      explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always in the
      forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the world," not
      just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
      through.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular, I think it's fascinating
      that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all these really powerful girl
      and women characters who were, for the most part, respected, at least in later
      years. Because when we first meet the Avatar world, we know
      that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all this power, she's in this
      position where she could eventually have the throne, she isn't respected by her own
      father.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But even Katara in the
      beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use waterbending beyond
      healing, and she goes on to become one of the greatest
      waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have this really
      powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends someone who is,
      up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more ruthless and so
      forth. So it was interesting to see all
      these female characters get to be complex and powerful and not have that held
      against them, unless you count Azula and how that ended for
      her.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But it was nice to see the LOK universe expand upon that and show
      us that things had changed in some ways. For one, we have Korra, who is the avatar,
      and she is this figure who
      is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity that we're
      accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants without
      concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think about her
      gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering herself
      inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this particular
      form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin and we see
      Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or they're
      dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with their
      mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well, if
      they do have children, and so forth. I don't know. It was an
      example of how that world had changed or was changing possibly for the
      better.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I'm like, "In what
      world am I supposed to view this as platonic? I mean, I know I was raised in a pretty
      fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing here things
      that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
      00:58:53] people." So that's when I became a
      believer. And the longer I watched the show, the more it seemed to grow.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And you could
      tell, from a fandom perspective, some people
      who are cishet won't be able to speak to this, but you could
      tell that the writer's room was split in how they were portraying the characters
      because I think they got
      uncomfortable with how fandom was growing so rapidly and intensely around these
      two characters, even to the
      point where they used the black character as a wedge between
      them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
      in that show. </li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But we basically
      had these two actors leaning into it because
      they didn't have a problem with it, but we see that some of the writers were
      uncomfortable, or I guess maybe the network or the showrunners were
      uncomfortable where the story was heading. And so they moved
      away from what was organically developing to the extent where they took two
      characters who never said more than a single word to each other, and one of these
      characters actively disliked the other character, and said, "Hey, we're going to
      have these two put together. And we are going to
      have your favorite superhero be shipped with a slave owner. So,
      yay, have fun with that."</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So when you start
      off with a show that has ... It's basically
      girl-next-door, blonde, blue-eyed, sort of hyper-feminine in some ways but also
      gender non-conforming in other ways super hero dating a black man, or having that
      black man being put as
      a love interest when that's usually not the case, especially for that kind of
      media.
      And then you break them apart in the second season
      and conveniently replace him with a white man who just actually makes the
      character feel terrible and
      derails her show, and starts to get almost as much screen time as she does even
      though he's not really an integral part of the show. Just so much went wrong so
      fast. He was so bad.</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I just find their relationship in
      canon to be so interesting because it was one of
      the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
      pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
      surprised.</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Brienne was what a lot of
      these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
      places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
      and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
      of her issues with not being able
      to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
      heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
      always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
      gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
      he always had a very strange affinity, but
      like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
      loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
      of view.</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
      reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
      very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
      and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit.</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>as like a side note, I think the show really undercut Jaime and Brienne's
      relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
      kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her. I was
      like, "Boy is a head shorter than her."</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That was part of the appeal was that Jaime had this big, beautiful wife that was taller
      than him
      and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
      wonderful?" That was part of what made it so enjoyable</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think that bit of the
      ending, was actually the one I had the least amount of problems with, out of all of
      it because its part of the King's guard. This was like an ideal kind of took Jaime's
      spot in like the head.</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I mean, personally, I think the whole bit where he leaves and comes
      back is bullshit. Like, I'm sorry, I can't even mince words with that</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That would have been a good way to end it, not, we're going to hug
      each other and we're going to let some rocks fall.</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I knew everything that was going to
      happen until about Season Four. And was perfectly happy with it, really wasn't
      paying any attention.</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
      Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
      Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
      no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
      brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
      thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
      wrote a Game of Thrones fan fiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
      series, the first one.</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
      think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
      little bit of character assassination.</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I literally got up off the couch and walked away when
      she got beheaded. I was very upset. It pissed me
      off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
      slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
      did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
      white women. That was very, very frustrating and irritating to
      me.</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
      of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
      That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
      that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
      better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
      they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
      would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23].</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
      agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
      dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
      that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
      Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
      we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
      that was a little irritating to me. So I wanted
      her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
      supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
      that.</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
      beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
      thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually liked
      Sandor Clegane, Sansa Stark as a pairing, whether it's through platonic, whether
      it's romantic, et cetera. It was just one of those good ones. I thought they had
      good scene chemistry together.</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
      and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
      stalker-y.</li>

  <h3>Quotes</h3>
  <ul>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
        I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
        but it felt more like a nod than a full</li>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
        a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
        but it's good.</li>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad.
        But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want
        to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want
        to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that!
        I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.[inaudible 00:47:08]
        what are other ways we can imagine it?</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah, I mean, I think
        when I was first getting into the fandom,
        one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
        strong. And it's true to a great extent. But I think what's
        even more fascinating to me, is how a lot of them tend to show that strength in so
        many different ways. Like, you have Sansa, who
        is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
        of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
        conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
        world. And then you have people like Margaery Tyrell and Cersei
        Lannister,</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I
        think it's just a relief to see how... Because to me, it's almost like a moment of
        such growth, is what I felt, when I felt Sansa. Because when you're young,
        [inaudible 01:20:56]. You want the perfect marriage, and
        the perfect husband, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't mean that
        you'll necessarily get it. And to me, at least, growing up is balancing those
        childhood desires, and those childhood needs with whatever you learn as you grow up.
        And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
        child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
        sure that nobody hurt her.</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think
        there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
        liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
        everything.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Okay, well, let's just do Korra next," because I was pretty sure
        that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
        of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
        of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
        watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I was very much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
        and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
        style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> That was
        Christmas break, but my grandma was staying over for the weekend, so I had to watch
        it silently at like midnight, and freak out quietly. As soon as Asami showed up on
        the screen, I must have lost
        it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
        happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I loved that. Even if, and I think
        once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
        maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
        to see
        that, but I liked that they
        weren't immediate, for the most part.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, we spend four seasons developing
        Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
        lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
        out</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
        see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
        god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
        have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it was also good that
        nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
        communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
        white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
        frankly.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At the time that the
        show was airing, it
        was kind of taboo for divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare
        for a widower to be portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife
        that he had lost, so it was a combination of really interesting
        things.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I was on Twitter casually
        scrolling through something, and someone from back home happened to mention how the
        finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background and
        the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
        that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
        Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
        I
        could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
        been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
        how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
        came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
        that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It was sort of ... To me, it
        was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is this
        all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having this
        really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once had,
        and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to deal
        with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so forth.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular, I think it's fascinating
        that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all these really powerful girl
        and women characters who were, for the most part, respected, at least in later
        years. Because when we first meet the Avatar world, we know
        that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all this power, she's in this
        position where she could eventually have the throne, she isn't respected by her own
        father.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But even Katara in the
        beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use waterbending beyond
        healing, and she goes on to become one of the greatest
        waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have this really
        powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends someone who is,
        up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more ruthless and so
        forth. So it was interesting to see all
        these female characters get to be complex and powerful and not have that held
        against them, unless you count Azula and how that ended for
        her.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But it was nice to see the LOK universe expand upon that and show
        us that things had changed in some ways. For one, we have Korra, who is the avatar,
        and she is this figure who
        is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity that we're
        accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants without
        concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think about her
        gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering herself
        inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this particular
        form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin and we see
        Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or they're
        dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with their
        mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well, if
        they do have children, and so forth. I don't know. It was an
        example of how that world had changed or was changing possibly for the
        better.</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I just find their relationship in
        canon to be so interesting because it was one of
        the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
        pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
        surprised.</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Brienne was what a lot of
        these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
        places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists

  <ul>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
        I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
        already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
        weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
        there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
        feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political
        institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family
        institutions. My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community
        college is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of
        people that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't
        talk about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
        that was the only source of information.</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So then I realized that Jodhaa Akbar, which is
        definitely a Desi film, had a wonderful set of characters that was definitely
        angsty, but had a wonderfully happy ending. And allowed me to write about something
        that was kind of dear to my heart as well. Because it was a Desi film. It was one
        representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
        those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
        to bridge them. Because you have to. Because it's not just
        about love, or it's not just about anything. It's about your pride, it's about your
        family's livelihood. All of those kind of come together, you have to do it. You
        don't want to, but, somehow, you have to. I think it's that gritting of your teeth,
        and getting on with life that kind of really draws me in.</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean that I just don't think I relate to him at the
        same extent that I relate to Sansa.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
        very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
        queer
        characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
        go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
        their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
        situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
        seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
        once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
        not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
        the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
        there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
        </li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
        it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
        since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
        until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
        a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
        decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
        this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
        case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
        Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
        bit.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
        was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
        possible love interests.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
        watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
        because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
        and so on.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And because
        I grew up in a country where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian
        content was part of our regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened,
        so it shaped what I was interested in.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I think with Twilight
        it was just that phase where you finally find a story that speaks to you, even if
        you kind of hate it when you look back at it when you're older. But at the time, how
        Bella was written both as someone who was
        insular and chooses to form or has a small community and so forth and deals with
        depression or whatever it is, it just seemed to be something
        that I could relate to.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it was more that it was
        very books for me because I
        grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on South America but as socially, politically
        part of the Caribbean, so most of the content that we were consuming was either
        shows from the US or whatever, maybe European shows might have filtered through,
        and that also was the case for the books that we were reading. And while it was
        the case within school for us to consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to
        read Caribbean literature as a person on my own.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So it was just discovering a collection
        of books in my own home from my aunt and my mother and so on, their teachers.
        And my aunt in particular,
        she teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
        them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
        were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
        know. I guess it comes back to not knowing what you're missing
        until you finally have it. So when I first read texts were people were actually talking
        about foods that I
        would eat or where people were living in communities like mine, where people
        spoke that way that I spoke, et cetera.
        Because even though I speak, let's say, like this,
        how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back home, it's a
        little different even though ... So, my particular country, we speak English,
        but it's a particular kind of English. So just seeing that in
        text and then realizing that the fantasies and so on that I was consuming were ...
        I
        don't know, it had these strange things that just didn't quite compute with where
        I
        was living. That's where it really clicked for me. And from that point onward, I
        think that's where I began to see it in everything else. The biggest shift didn't
        really come until I moved to the US,
        because back home I
        was part of the majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing
        yourself in other ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in
        the news as a politician, et cetera. But here it was a completely different
        ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't know, it just ... There may have been other works of
        fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that was when Korra
        just seemed more human.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>we see Korra actual deal, for more than one
        episode, with how she's effected by these things, and to me that was
        different.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>You
        actually get to see an avatar. And yes, Aang did deal with this too, but it's ...
        I
        don't know. It's just different for me. Deal
        with PTSD and depression and just all these changing things. It
        was interesting.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>everyone has seen someone who they think is all-powerful and
        infallible, invulnerable to an extent, be ... I don't want to say broken, but be injured
        in a really drastic way and them not
        being able to do anything much to help with her recovery in concrete
        ways.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I'm like, "In what
        world am I supposed to view this as platonic? I mean, I know I was raised in a pretty
        fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing here things
        that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
        00:58:53] people." So that's when I became a
        believer. And the longer I watched the show, the more it seemed to grow.</li>

  <h3>Quotes</h3>
  <ul>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
        have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
        in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
        context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
        very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
        you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
        original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
        through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
        and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
        with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
        get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
        you.</li>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
        I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
        already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
        weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
        a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
        different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
        in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
        and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
        looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think if you look at A Song of Ice and Fire, technically,
        more than Game of Thrones, you
        actually get more of a cultural tension due to just the difference between the
        North and the South. And all of that. And I do think that George R. R. Martin
        has kind of perpetuated the idea, simply because he is English. So, the whole
        idea that in England, where Northerners are tougher and everything than
        Southerners. And I don't know anything more about it. But I think that's kind of
        one of the underlying and unconscious biases within the framework of the
        canon.</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, obviously, Season Eight was terrible.
        That was a given. And the ending did not do anyone any favors.</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And second of all, the actual TV show was not doing itself any
        favors. </li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I actually do remember how unhappy people were that Sansa didn't
        end with a love interest at the end of Season Eight.</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, obviously, there's a ton of other problems. How [inaudible
        01:21:42] Daenerys, and Cersei, and Jaime. And a number of other characters.</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I could understand why people felt unhappy about it. But at the same time, I
        think you're beating on the wrong bush here. There's a lot of other problems to deal
        with within this fandom. And within this canon that we don't particularly need as
        much as you're putting into it.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
        don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
        came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
        into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
        ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
        super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
        of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
        relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
        should take five steps back, and let's just
        focus on these two.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think in the first two
        books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I guess her experiences
        are fantastical in a sense.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korra
        gets to her lowest point.  The implication is
        that she's about to jump off a cliff. But we don't really get to dwell in the
        true feeling of that moment, the have to fix it immediately because of the idea
        that the show may never get to come back to this point, so we don't get to
        actually see what that means for her.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it's just existing
        personally as a marginalized person. The way that that storyline was handled in LOK,
        I think I wasn't quite comfortable with it, just the very idea of the movement
        disappearing because of one man's end. It seems so unrealistic because there was a
        real situation with inequality there. Because we see that the world has adapted to
        cater for benders, and we don't quite know non-benders are faring in that world,
        what kind of opportunities they're having. And based on the conflict that the show
        raised, it was clear that non-benders were in a position where they weren't having
        ends meet or they weren't getting the jobs that they hoped to get.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
        interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
        we
        kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
        thing about fandom and fan
        fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that either there
        wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important enough to
        explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always in the
        forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the world," not
        just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
        through.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And you could
        tell, from a fandom perspective, some people
        who are cishet won't be able to speak to this, but you could
        tell that the writer's room was split in how they were portraying the characters
        because I think they got
        uncomfortable with how fandom was growing so rapidly and intensely around these
        two characters, even to the
        point where they used the black character as a wedge between
        them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
        in that show. </li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But we basically
        had these two actors leaning into it because
        they didn't have a problem with it, but we see that some of the writers were
        uncomfortable, or I guess maybe the network or the showrunners were
        uncomfortable where the story was heading. And so they moved
        away from what was organically developing to the extent where they took two
        characters who never said more than a single word to each other, and one of these
        characters actively disliked the other character, and said, "Hey, we're going to
        have these two put together. And we are going to
        have your favorite superhero be shipped with a slave owner. So,
        yay, have fun with that."</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So when you start
        off with a show that has ... It's basically
        girl-next-door, blonde, blue-eyed, sort of hyper-feminine in some ways but also
        gender non-conforming in other ways super hero dating a black man, or having that
        black man being put as
        a love interest when that's usually not the case, especially for that kind of
        media.
        And then you break them apart in the second season
        and conveniently replace him with a white man who just actually makes the
        character feel terrible and
        derails her show, and starts to get almost as much screen time as she does even
        though he's not really an integral part of the show. Just so much went wrong so
        fast. He was so bad.</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>as like a side note, I think the show really undercut Jaime and Brienne's
        relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
        kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her. I was
        like, "Boy is a head shorter than her."</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I mean, personally, I think the whole bit where he leaves and comes
        back is bullshit. Like, I'm sorry, I can't even mince words with that</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That would have been a good way to end it, not, we're going to hug
        each other and we're going to let some rocks fall.</li>
     <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
        Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
        Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
        no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
        brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
        thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
        wrote a Game of Thrones fan fiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
        series, the first one.</li>
     <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
        think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
        little bit of character assassination.</li>
     <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I literally got up off the couch and walked away when
        she got beheaded. I was very upset. It pissed me
        off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
        slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
        did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
        white women. That was very, very frustrating and irritating to
        me.</li>
     <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
        of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
        That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
     <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
        that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that</li>
     <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
        better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
        they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
        would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23].</li>
     <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
        agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
        dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
        that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
        Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
        we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
        that was a little irritating to me. So I wanted
        her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
        supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
        that.</li>
     <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
        beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
        thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
     <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
        and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
        stalker-y.</li>
  </ul>
