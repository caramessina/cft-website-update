   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
         have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
         in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
         very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
         you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
         original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
         through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
         and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
         with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
         get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
         you.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
         I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
         already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
         weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
         I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
         but it felt more like a nod than a full</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
         there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
         feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
         a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
         different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
         in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
         and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
         looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political
         institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family
         institutions. My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community
         college is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of
         people that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't
         talk about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
         that was the only source of information.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
         a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
         but it's good.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad.
         But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want
         to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want
         to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that!
         I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.[inaudible 00:47:08]
         what are other ways we can imagine it?</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So then I realized that Jodhaa Akbar, which is
         definitely a Desi film, had a wonderful set of characters that was definitely
         angsty, but had a wonderfully happy ending. And allowed me to write about something
         that was kind of dear to my heart as well. Because it was a Desi film. It was one
         representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
         those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
         to bridge them. Because you have to. Because it's not just
         about love, or it's not just about anything. It's about your pride, it's about your
         family's livelihood. All of those kind of come together, you have to do it. You
         don't want to, but, somehow, you have to. I think it's that gritting of your teeth,
         and getting on with life that kind of really draws me in.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean that I just don't think I relate to him at the
         same extent that I relate to Sansa.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think if you look at A Song of Ice and Fire, technically,
         more than Game of Thrones, you
         actually get more of a cultural tension due to just the difference between the
         North and the South. And all of that. And I do think that George R. R. Martin
         has kind of perpetuated the idea, simply because he is English. So, the whole
         idea that in England, where Northerners are tougher and everything than
         Southerners. And I don't know anything more about it. But I think that's kind of
         one of the underlying and unconscious biases within the framework of the
         canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, obviously, Season Eight was terrible.
         That was a given. And the ending did not do anyone any favors.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And second of all, the actual TV show was not doing itself any
         favors. </li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah, I mean, I think
         when I was first getting into the fandom,
         one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
         strong. And it's true to a great extent. But I think what's
         even more fascinating to me, is how a lot of them tend to show that strength in so
         many different ways. Like, you have Sansa, who
         is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
         of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
         conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
         world. And then you have people like Margaery Tyrell and Cersei
         Lannister,</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I actually do remember how unhappy people were that Sansa didn't
         end with a love interest at the end of Season Eight.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I
         think it's just a relief to see how... Because to me, it's almost like a moment of
         such growth, is what I felt, when I felt Sansa. Because when you're young,
         [inaudible 01:20:56]. You want the perfect marriage, and
         the perfect husband, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't mean that
         you'll necessarily get it. And to me, at least, growing up is balancing those
         childhood desires, and those childhood needs with whatever you learn as you grow up.
         And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
         child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
         sure that nobody hurt her.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think
         there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
         liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
         everything.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, obviously, there's a ton of other problems. How [inaudible
         01:21:42] Daenerys, and Cersei, and Jaime. And a number of other characters.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I could understand why people felt unhappy about it. But at the same time, I
         think you're beating on the wrong bush here. There's a lot of other problems to deal
         with within this fandom. And within this canon that we don't particularly need as
         much as you're putting into it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
         very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
         queer
         characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
         go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
         their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
         situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
         don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
         came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
         into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
         ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Okay, well, let's just do Korra next," because I was pretty sure
         that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
         of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
         of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
         watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I was very much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
         and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
         style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
         seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
         once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
         not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
         the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
         there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
         </li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
         super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
         of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
         relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
         should take five steps back, and let's just
         focus on these two.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> That was
         Christmas break, but my grandma was staying over for the weekend, so I had to watch
         it silently at like midnight, and freak out quietly. As soon as Asami showed up on
         the screen, I must have lost
         it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
         happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I loved that. Even if, and I think
         once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
         maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
         to see
         that, but I liked that they
         weren't immediate, for the most part.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
         it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
         since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
         until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
         a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
         decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
         this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
         case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
         Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
         bit.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
         was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
         possible love interests.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, we spend four seasons developing
         Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
         lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
         out</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
         see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
         god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
         have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it was also good that
         nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
         communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
         white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
         frankly.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
         watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
         because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
         and so on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At the
         time that the show was airing, it was kind of taboo for
         divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
         portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
         it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And because I grew up in a country
         where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian content was part of our
         regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened, so it shaped what I was
         interested in.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I
         think with Twilight it was just that phase where you finally find a
         story that speaks to you, even if you kind of hate it when you look back at it when
         you're older. But at the time, how
         Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
         small community and so forth and deals with depression or
         whatever it is, it just seemed to be something that I could relate to. And so
         I was both interested in that, and I guess in the power fantasy that she was written
         to
         come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
         characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it was more
         that it was very books for me because I grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on
         South America but as socially, politically part of the Caribbean, so most of the
         content that we were consuming was either shows from the US or whatever, maybe
         European shows might have filtered through, and that also was the case for the
         books that we were reading. And while it was the case within school for us to
         consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to read Caribbean literature as a
         person on my own.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So it was just discovering a collection of books in my
         own home from my aunt and my mother and so on, their teachers. And my aunt in particular,
         she
         teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
         them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
         were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
         know. I guess it comes back to not knowing what you're missing
         until you finally have it. So when I first read texts were people
         were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living
         in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et
         cetera.
         Because even though I speak, let's say,
         like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
         home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
         speak English, but it's a particular kind of English. So just
         seeing that in text and then realizing that the fantasies and so on that I was
         consuming were ... I don't know, it had these strange things that just didn't quite
         compute with where I was living. That's where it really clicked for me. And from
         that point onward, I think that's where I began to see it in everything else. The
         biggest shift didn't really come until I moved to the US, because back home I was
         part of the
         majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing yourself in other
         ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in the news as a
         politician, et cetera. But here it was a completely different
         ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
         was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
         happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background
         and
         the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
         that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
         Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
         I
         could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
         been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
         how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
         came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
         that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think
         in the first two books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I
         guess her experiences are fantastical in a sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It was sort of ... To me,
         it was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is
         this all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having
         this really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once
         had, and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to
         deal with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so
         forth.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't know, it just ... There may have been
         other works of fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that
         was when Korra just seemed more human.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korra gets to her lowest point.  The implication is that she's about to jump off a
         cliff. But
         we don't really get to dwell in the true feeling of that moment, the have to fix
         it immediately because of the idea that the show may never get to come back to
         this point, so we don't get to actually see what that means for
         her.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>we see Korra actual deal, for more than one episode, with how
         she's effected by these things, and to me that was different.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>You actually get to see an
         avatar. And yes, Aang did deal with this too, but it's ... I don't know.
         It's just different for me.
         Deal with PTSD and depression and just all these changing
         things. It was interesting.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>everyone has seen someone who they think is
         all-powerful and infallible, invulnerable to an extent, be ... I don't want to say
         broken, but be injured in a
         really drastic way and them not being able to do anything much to help with her
         recovery in concrete ways.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think
         it's just existing personally as a marginalized person. The way that that storyline
         was handled in LOK, I think I wasn't quite comfortable with it, just the very idea
         of the movement disappearing because of one man's end. It seems so unrealistic
         because there was a real situation with inequality there. Because we see that the
         world has adapted to cater for benders, and we don't quite know non-benders are
         faring in that world, what kind of opportunities they're having. And based on the
         conflict that the show raised, it was clear that non-benders were in a position
         where they weren't having ends meet or they weren't getting the jobs that they hoped
         to get.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
         interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
         we
         kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
         thing about fandom
         and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
         either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
         enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
         in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
         world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
         through.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular,
         I think it's fascinating that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all
         these really powerful girl and women characters who were, for the most part,
         respected, at least in later years. Because when we first meet
         the Avatar world, we know that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all
         this power, she's in this position where she could eventually have the throne, she
         isn't respected by her own father.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But even Katara in the beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use
         waterbending beyond healing, and she goes on to become one of
         the greatest waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have
         this really powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends
         someone who is, up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more
         ruthless and so forth. So it was
         interesting to see all these female characters get to be complex and powerful
         and not have that held against them, unless you count Azula and
         how that ended for her.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But it was nice to see the LOK universe expand
         upon that and show us that things had changed in some ways. For one, we have Korra,
         who is the avatar, and she is this
         figure who is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity
         that we're accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants
         without concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think
         about her gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering
         herself inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this
         particular form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin
         and we see Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or
         they're dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with
         their mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well,
         if they do have children, and so forth. I don't know. It was an
         example of how that world had changed or was changing possibly for the
         better.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I'm
         like, "In what world am I supposed to view this as platonic? I mean, I know I was
         raised
         in a pretty fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing
         here things that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
         00:58:53] people." So that's when I became a
         believer. And the longer I watched the show, the more it seemed to grow.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And
         you could tell, from a fandom perspective, some people who are cishet won't be able
         to speak to
         this, but you could tell that the writer's room was split in
         how they were portraying the characters because I think they got uncomfortable with
         how fandom
         was growing so rapidly and intensely around these two
         characters, even
         to the point where they used the black character as a wedge between
         them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
         in that show. </li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But we basically had these two
         actors leaning into it because they didn't have a problem with
         it, but we see that some of the writers were
         uncomfortable, or I guess maybe the network or the showrunners were
         uncomfortable where the story was heading. And so they moved
         away from what was organically developing to the extent where they took two
         characters who never said more than a single word to each other, and one of these
         characters actively disliked the other character, and said, "Hey, we're going to
         have these two put together. And we are
         going to have your favorite superhero be shipped with a slave
         owner. So, yay, have fun with that."</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So
         when you start off with a show that has ... It's basically girl-next-door, blonde,
         blue-eyed, sort of
         hyper-feminine in some ways but also gender non-conforming in other ways super
         hero dating a
         black man, or having that black man being put as a love interest when that's
         usually not the case, especially for that kind of media.
         And then you break them apart in the
         second season and conveniently replace him with a white man who just actually
         makes the character feel terrible and derails her show, and starts to get almost as
         much screen
         time as she does even though he's not really an integral part of the show. Just
         so much went wrong so fast. He was so bad.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I just find their relationship in
         canon to be so interesting because it was one of
         the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
         pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
         surprised.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Brienne was what a lot of
         these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
         places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
         and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
         of her issues with not being able
         to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
         heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
         always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
         gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
         he always had a very strange affinity, but
         like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
         loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
         of view.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
         reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
         very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
         and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>as like a side note, I think the show really undercut Jaime and Brienne's
         relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
         kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her. I was
         like, "Boy is a head shorter than her."</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That was part of the appeal was that Jaime had this big, beautiful wife that was taller
         than him
         and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
         wonderful?" That was part of what made it so enjoyable</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think that bit of the
         ending, was actually the one I had the least amount of problems with, out of all of
         it because its part of the King's guard. This was like an ideal kind of took Jaime's
         spot in like the head.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I mean, personally, I think the whole bit where he leaves and comes
         back is bullshit. Like, I'm sorry, I can't even mince words with that</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That would have been a good way to end it, not, we're going to hug
         each other and we're going to let some rocks fall.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I knew everything that was going to
         happen until about Season Four. And was perfectly happy with it, really wasn't
         paying any attention.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
         Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
         Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
         no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
         brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
         thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
         wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
         series, the first one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
         think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
         little bit of character assassination.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong> So seeing that, and kind of juxtaposing it against the Sansa
         we were getting in the show was a little irksome.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I literally got up off the couch and walked away when
         she got beheaded. I was very upset. It pissed me
         off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
         slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
         did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
         white women. That was very, very frustrating and irritating to
         me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That seemed completely out of
         character for me. The whole scene was out of character for me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
         of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
         That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I adore the Dorne
         storyline in the books, and they completely butchered it in the show. So, that's why
         I
         was like, no Dorne's way smarter than this. So yes, he's going to be the Dorne that
         you
         get in the books.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
         that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
         better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
         they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
         would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23].</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
         dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
         that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
         Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
         beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
         thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually liked
         Sandor Clegane, Sansa Stark as a pairing, whether it's through platonic, whether
         it's romantic, et cetera. It was just one of those good ones. I thought they had
         good scene chemistry together. I always thought he kind of saw her,
         especially in the beginning as, he called her a little bird. Like, "I see that your
         parents never prepared you for this. Your best safe kept in a cage locked away, and
         you
         can just sing to people." I always liked that about him.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
         and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
         stalker-y.</li>

  <h2>Canon Compliment</h2>
  <div class="interview-search-analysis">
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors’ compliment the canonical material, including its writing, ideologies, identity representation, and more.</p>
  <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 28</p>
  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> All six of the fan authors share characters, moments, or identity representation that made them fall in love with and feel connected to the shows. These compliments are not necessarily about what the show did technically well, but how each fan developed an emotional investment with the show. </p>
  <p>For fans of both TLOK and GOT, each author expresses excitement for different forms of representation that resist normative notions of gender and sexuality. For example, the final episode of TLOK, when Korra/Asami’s romantic relationship--and thus bisexuality-- is confirmed canon, resonates with Aria and Gillywulf. Gillywulf describes elation, saying, “But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, ‘This is happening, right?’ Yeah. I was like, ‘Jesus.’” Gillywulf’s excitement in this final episode appears across her and the other TLOK fans’ interviews. In both TLOK and GOT, authors point to the canon resisting gender norms as another reason they love the shows. Several authors describe how different characters oppose gender stereotypes. For instance, from the GOT authors, Dialux cites she was originally drawn to the show because she heard it portrayed “strong women.” Valk interprets Jaime and Brienne as characters who do not conform to gender norms, saying Jaime has an “affinity for feminity.” Valk also points to this non-conformity as one of the reasons they ship them: “That was part of the appeal was that Jaime had this big, beautiful wife that was taller than him and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge..and wonderful?” Valk specifically points to Brienne’s size in comparison to Jaime’s as one of the reasons Valk loves their characters. As for TLOK, Kittya argues that pretty much every woman from both TLOK and Avatar: The Last Airbender is well-developed and strong. Korra particularly, as Kittya describes, “is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity that we're accustomed to.” Korra is muscular, physically powerful, can be sarcastic, and has a firey temper. Yet, the show's writers allow her to be vulnerable and make mistakes.</p>
  <p>	The fan authors’ love and compliments for the canon is often tied to characters, specifically how each author interprets characters’ representations as resisting normativity.</p>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
         I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
         but it felt more like a nod than a full</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
         a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
         but it's good.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad.
         But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want
         to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want
         to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that!
         I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.[inaudible 00:47:08]
         what are other ways we can imagine it?</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah, I mean, I think
         when I was first getting into the fandom,
         one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
         strong. And it's true to a great extent. But I think what's
         even more fascinating to me, is how a lot of them tend to show that strength in so
         many different ways. Like, you have Sansa, who
         is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
         of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
         conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
         world. And then you have people like Margaery Tyrell and Cersei
         Lannister,</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I
         think it's just a relief to see how... Because to me, it's almost like a moment of
         such growth, is what I felt, when I felt Sansa. Because when you're young,
         [inaudible 01:20:56]. You want the perfect marriage, and
         the perfect husband, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't mean that
         you'll necessarily get it. And to me, at least, growing up is balancing those
         childhood desires, and those childhood needs with whatever you learn as you grow up.
         And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
         child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
         sure that nobody hurt her.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think
         there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
         liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
         everything.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Okay, well, let's just do Korra next," because I was pretty sure
         that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
         of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
         of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
         watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I was very much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
         and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
         style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> That was
         Christmas break, but my grandma was staying over for the weekend, so I had to watch
         it silently at like midnight, and freak out quietly. As soon as Asami showed up on
         the screen, I must have lost
         it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
         happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I loved that. Even if, and I think
         once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
         maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
         to see
         that, but I liked that they
         weren't immediate, for the most part.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, we spend four seasons developing
         Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
         lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
         out</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
         see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
         god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
         have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it was also good that
         nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
         communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
         white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
         frankly.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At the
         time that the show was airing, it was kind of taboo for
         divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
         portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
         it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
         was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
         happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background
         and
         the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
         that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
         Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
         I
         could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
         been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
         how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
         came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
         that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It was sort of ... To me,
         it was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is
         this all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having
         this really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once
         had, and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to
         deal with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so
         forth.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>we see Korra actual deal, for more than one episode, with how
         she's effected by these things, and to me that was different.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular,
         I think it's fascinating that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all
         these really powerful girl and women characters who were, for the most part,
         respected, at least in later years. Because when we first meet
         the Avatar world, we know that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all
         this power, she's in this position where she could eventually have the throne, she
         isn't respected by her own father.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But even Katara in the beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use
         waterbending beyond healing, and she goes on to become one of
         the greatest waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have
         this really powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends
         someone who is, up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more
         ruthless and so forth. So it was
         interesting to see all these female characters get to be complex and powerful
         and not have that held against them, unless you count Azula and
         how that ended for her.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But it was nice to see the LOK universe expand
         upon that and show us that things had changed in some ways. For one, we have Korra,
         who is the avatar, and she is this
         figure who is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity
         that we're accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants
         without concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think
         about her gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering
         herself inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this
         particular form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin
         and we see Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or
         they're dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with
         their mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well,
         if they do have children, and so forth. I don't know. It was an
         example of how that world had changed or was changing possibly for the
         better.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I just find their relationship in
         canon to be so interesting because it was one of
         the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
         pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
         surprised.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Brienne was what a lot of
         these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
         places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
         and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
         of her issues with not being able
         to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
         heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
         always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
         gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
         he always had a very strange affinity, but
         like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
         loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
         of view.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
         reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
         very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
         and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That was part of the appeal was that Jaime had this big, beautiful wife that was taller
         than him
         and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
         wonderful?" That was part of what made it so enjoyable</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think that bit of the
         ending, was actually the one I had the least amount of problems with, out of all of
         it because its part of the King's guard. This was like an ideal kind of took Jaime's
         spot in like the head.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I knew everything that was going to
         happen until about Season Four. And was perfectly happy with it, really wasn't
         paying any attention.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually liked
         Sandor Clegane, Sansa Stark as a pairing, whether it's through platonic, whether
         it's romantic, et cetera. It was just one of those good ones. I thought they had
         good scene chemistry together. I always thought he kind of saw her,
         especially in the beginning as, he called her a little bird. Like, "I see that your
         parents never prepared you for this. Your best safe kept in a cage locked away, and
         you
         can just sing to people." I always liked that about him.</li>

  <h2>Canon Relation</h2>
  <div class="interview-search-analysis">
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan interviewees’ describes how they relate to the canonical material or moments they relate to.</p>
  <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 18</p>
  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> s both the canon compliment and the canon critique quotes show, fan authors’ relation to canon materials is usually tied to how their lived experiences are or are not represented in a text. Aria explicitly says, “Oh, I love this, I love feeling represented,” as part of her motivation for writing a TLOK fanfic, specifically in reference to Korra and Asami’s confirmed relationship and bisexuality. Gillywulf builds off Aria’s point, citing the TLOK fan community and writing fanfic as a way to explore different coming out situations. She says “so, I had decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, ‘It could be this, or it could be that.’” Through her 400-chapter-long fanfiction and other ways of interacting with TLOK fandom, she prepared herself to come out, hoping her story would be one of acceptance. </p>
  <p>As Gillywulf and Aria describe relating to the queer representation in TLOK, Dialux and Kittya point to how representations of their cultures drew them into specific texts. Dialux and Kittya both talk about texts different from GOT and TLOK, but they still brought up their cultural contexts. Dialux decided to write a fanfic about GOT characters in the Jodhaa Akbar universe, a film about historical India. She mentions she was drawn to the film because, “it was a Desi film,” and she is Desi, but also she wanted to explore the cultural and religious tensions that the film explores, similar tensions explored in GOT.  Kittya, when telling her fan story, shares how she grew up in Guyana, where she engaged with Indian cultural content. When she moved to the US, she found herself relying on online fandoms to translate Indian television shows. As she continued to read and engage with texts, she found herself drawn to texts “where people were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et cetera.” She also, though, points to realizing an absence of representation in US culture, which she describes as “insidious.”</p>
  <p>The moments when fans describe relating correlate with a lack of normalized representation of their culture, sexuality, and other aspects of their identity. When aspects of fans’ lived experiences and identities are often mis- or not represented in popular culture, fans develop deeper connections with texts that do represent them.</p>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
         I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
         already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
         weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
         there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
         feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political
         institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family
         institutions. My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community
         college is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of
         people that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't
         talk about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
         that was the only source of information.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So then I realized that Jodhaa Akbar, which is
         definitely a Desi film, had a wonderful set of characters that was definitely
         angsty, but had a wonderfully happy ending. And allowed me to write about something
         that was kind of dear to my heart as well. Because it was a Desi film. It was one
         representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
         those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
         to bridge them. Because you have to. Because it's not just
         about love, or it's not just about anything. It's about your pride, it's about your
         family's livelihood. All of those kind of come together, you have to do it. You
         don't want to, but, somehow, you have to. I think it's that gritting of your teeth,
         and getting on with life that kind of really draws me in.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean that I just don't think I relate to him at the
         same extent that I relate to Sansa.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
         very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
         queer
         characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
         go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
         their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
         situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
         seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
         once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
         not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
         the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
         there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
         </li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
         it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
         since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
         until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
         a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
         decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
         this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
         case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
         Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
         bit.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
         was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
         possible love interests.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
         watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
         because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
         and so on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And because I grew up in a country
         where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian content was part of our
         regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened, so it shaped what I was
         interested in.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I
         think with Twilight it was just that phase where you finally find a
         story that speaks to you, even if you kind of hate it when you look back at it when
         you're older. But at the time, how
         Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
         small community and so forth and deals with depression or
         whatever it is, it just seemed to be something that I could relate to. And so
         I was both interested in that, and I guess in the power fantasy that she was written
         to
         come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
         characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it was more
         that it was very books for me because I grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on
         South America but as socially, politically part of the Caribbean, so most of the
         content that we were consuming was either shows from the US or whatever, maybe
         European shows might have filtered through, and that also was the case for the
         books that we were reading. And while it was the case within school for us to
         consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to read Caribbean literature as a
         person on my own.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So it was just discovering a collection of books in my
         own home from my aunt and my mother and so on, their teachers. And my aunt in particular,
         she
         teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
         them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
         were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
         know. I guess it comes back to not knowing what you're missing
         until you finally have it. So when I first read texts were people
         were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living
         in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et
         cetera.
         Because even though I speak, let's say,
         like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
         home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
         speak English, but it's a particular kind of English. So just
         seeing that in text and then realizing that the fantasies and so on that I was
         consuming were ... I don't know, it had these strange things that just didn't quite
         compute with where I was living. That's where it really clicked for me. And from
         that point onward, I think that's where I began to see it in everything else. The
         biggest shift didn't really come until I moved to the US, because back home I was
         part of the
         majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing yourself in other
         ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in the news as a
         politician, et cetera. But here it was a completely different
         ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't know, it just ... There may have been
         other works of fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that
         was when Korra just seemed more human.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>You actually get to see an
         avatar. And yes, Aang did deal with this too, but it's ... I don't know.
         It's just different for me.
         Deal with PTSD and depression and just all these changing
         things. It was interesting.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>everyone has seen someone who they think is
         all-powerful and infallible, invulnerable to an extent, be ... I don't want to say
         broken, but be injured in a
         really drastic way and them not being able to do anything much to help with her
         recovery in concrete ways.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I'm
         like, "In what world am I supposed to view this as platonic? I mean, I know I was
         raised
         in a pretty fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing
         here things that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
         00:58:53] people." So that's when I became a
         believer. And the longer I watched the show, the more it seemed to grow.</li>

  <h2>Canon Critique</h2>
  <div class="interview-search-analysis">
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan interviewees’ critique the canonical text, including critiquing the writing, ideologies, identity representation (or lack thereof), and more.
</p>
  <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 34</p>
  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The fan authors’ critiques of the canon often point at the actual writing and character arcs portrayed on the show, demonstrating that each author has their own individual interpretations of the show. Some of their interpretations of the show revolve around the “believability” of characters’ experience; fan authors speak to either their own lived experiences or the lived experiences of people within their communities. Other authors point out that the television show writers’ choices reinscribe harmful dominant ideologies with their writing choices. This critique resonates with the inability for some writers to capture particular lived experiences.</p>
  <p>WriteGirl and Valk, for example, both critique the GOT’s writers’ choices in season 8. Valk argues that Jaime and Brienne’s love scene contradicts previous aesthetics of their relationship. Specifically, they point to how Brienne is depicted as smaller than Jaime when they kiss, even though Brienne is the taller character. Valk notices that the writers’ and directors’ choices to make Brienne smaller than Jaime reinscribes a heteronormative notion of gender roles — Brienne, as the woman, must be smaller than Jaime, the man.  WriteGirl also critiques the GOT’s writers’ treatment of Missandei, arguing that their choice for Missandei to “die in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two white women” erases her liberatory narrative arc that her character followed from earlier seasons.</p>
  <p>TLOK fanfiction authors also critique the writers’ choices. Aria points to how Korra survives through a traumatic injury and battle, which leads her to developed post-traumatic stress disorder. In the show, Korra lives with PTSD for quite some time, but then slowly recovers from it. Aria expresses that she wished the show better represented how people living with PTSD may not recover and must “come to live with,” rather than portraying it as something that can be fixed. Kittya Cullen has a similar critique that the show brushes past mental health; she points to a moment in season 1 that she interprets as Korra contemplating dying from suicide. Korra’s contemplation quickly ends as the show ends. Kittya wishes that the writers let Korra “dwell in the true feeling of that moment” instead of immediately resolving this storyline. Both Kittya and Aria’s critiques points to how the canon misrepresented the lived experiences of people living with disabilities, especially PTSD.</p>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
         have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
         in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
         very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
         you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
         original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
         through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
         and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
         with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
         get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
         you.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
         I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
         already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
         weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
         a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
         different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
         in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
         and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
         looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think if you look at A Song of Ice and Fire, technically,
         more than Game of Thrones, you
         actually get more of a cultural tension due to just the difference between the
         North and the South. And all of that. And I do think that George R. R. Martin
         has kind of perpetuated the idea, simply because he is English. So, the whole
         idea that in England, where Northerners are tougher and everything than
         Southerners. And I don't know anything more about it. But I think that's kind of
         one of the underlying and unconscious biases within the framework of the
         canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, obviously, Season Eight was terrible.
         That was a given. And the ending did not do anyone any favors.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And second of all, the actual TV show was not doing itself any
         favors. </li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I actually do remember how unhappy people were that Sansa didn't
         end with a love interest at the end of Season Eight.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, obviously, there's a ton of other problems. How [inaudible
         01:21:42] Daenerys, and Cersei, and Jaime. And a number of other characters.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I could understand why people felt unhappy about it. But at the same time, I
         think you're beating on the wrong bush here. There's a lot of other problems to deal
         with within this fandom. And within this canon that we don't particularly need as
         much as you're putting into it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
         don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
         came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
         into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
         ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
         super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
         of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
         relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
         should take five steps back, and let's just
         focus on these two.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think
         in the first two books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I
         guess her experiences are fantastical in a sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korra gets to her lowest point.  The implication is that she's about to jump off a
         cliff. But
         we don't really get to dwell in the true feeling of that moment, the have to fix
         it immediately because of the idea that the show may never get to come back to
         this point, so we don't get to actually see what that means for
         her.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think
         it's just existing personally as a marginalized person. The way that that storyline
         was handled in LOK, I think I wasn't quite comfortable with it, just the very idea
         of the movement disappearing because of one man's end. It seems so unrealistic
         because there was a real situation with inequality there. Because we see that the
         world has adapted to cater for benders, and we don't quite know non-benders are
         faring in that world, what kind of opportunities they're having. And based on the
         conflict that the show raised, it was clear that non-benders were in a position
         where they weren't having ends meet or they weren't getting the jobs that they hoped
         to get.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
         interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
         we
         kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
         thing about fandom
         and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
         either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
         enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
         in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
         world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
         through.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And
         you could tell, from a fandom perspective, some people who are cishet won't be able
         to speak to
         this, but you could tell that the writer's room was split in
         how they were portraying the characters because I think they got uncomfortable with
         how fandom
         was growing so rapidly and intensely around these two
         characters, even
         to the point where they used the black character as a wedge between
         them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
         in that show. </li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But we basically had these two
         actors leaning into it because they didn't have a problem with
         it, but we see that some of the writers were
         uncomfortable, or I guess maybe the network or the showrunners were
         uncomfortable where the story was heading. And so they moved
         away from what was organically developing to the extent where they took two
         characters who never said more than a single word to each other, and one of these
         characters actively disliked the other character, and said, "Hey, we're going to
         have these two put together. And we are
         going to have your favorite superhero be shipped with a slave
         owner. So, yay, have fun with that."</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So
         when you start off with a show that has ... It's basically girl-next-door, blonde,
         blue-eyed, sort of
         hyper-feminine in some ways but also gender non-conforming in other ways super
         hero dating a
         black man, or having that black man being put as a love interest when that's
         usually not the case, especially for that kind of media.
         And then you break them apart in the
         second season and conveniently replace him with a white man who just actually
         makes the character feel terrible and derails her show, and starts to get almost as
         much screen
         time as she does even though he's not really an integral part of the show. Just
         so much went wrong so fast. He was so bad.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>as like a side note, I think the show really undercut Jaime and Brienne's
         relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
         kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her. I was
         like, "Boy is a head shorter than her."</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I mean, personally, I think the whole bit where he leaves and comes
         back is bullshit. Like, I'm sorry, I can't even mince words with that</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That would have been a good way to end it, not, we're going to hug
         each other and we're going to let some rocks fall.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
         Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
         Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
         no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
         brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
         thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
         wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
         series, the first one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
         think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
         little bit of character assassination.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong> So seeing that, and kind of juxtaposing it against the Sansa
         we were getting in the show was a little irksome.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I literally got up off the couch and walked away when
         she got beheaded. I was very upset. It pissed me
         off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
         slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
         did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
         white women. That was very, very frustrating and irritating to
         me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That seemed completely out of
         character for me. The whole scene was out of character for me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
         of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
         That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I adore the Dorne
         storyline in the books, and they completely butchered it in the show. So, that's why
         I
         was like, no Dorne's way smarter than this. So yes, he's going to be the Dorne that
         you
         get in the books.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
         that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
         better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
         they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
         would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23].</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
         dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
         that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
         Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
         beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
         thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
         and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
         stalker-y.</li>
