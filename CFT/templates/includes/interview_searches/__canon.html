<h3>Canon Compliment</h3>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
      I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
      but it felt more like a nod than a full  There are things I don't like about it, but
      I like it as a little bit of text. It's there in the text, it was one of those things
      that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love feeling represented." So I wrote that. I chose
      the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading a...
      I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
      different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
      in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
      and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
      looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
      a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
      but it's good. Also I think it's when fiction ends, it does draw people who are like,
      "Oh, I want to write more on this subject, I want to play with these concepts again."
      There's also a distinct un-ended-ness I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration
      is limited, is kind of bad. But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where
      it's like, they just want to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did
      see them agree, yeah I want to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this,
      it's healthy. I love that! I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage
      with.[inaudible 00:47:08] what are other ways we can imagine it? And that creates
      fanon, which means you get this whole long space of people being like, "Oh yeah, I
      am writing about this content of fanon in this alternate universe, I'm going to write
      a piece about a radio show It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of
      [inaudible 00:47:39], some of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion
      that comes out of that. So I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and
      I think that it's liberating for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah, I mean, I think
      when I was first getting into the fandom,
      one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
      strong. And it's true to a great extent. But I think what's
      even more fascinating to me, is how a lot of them tend to show that strength in so
      many different ways. Like, you have Sansa, who
      is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
      of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
      conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
      world. And then you have people like Margaery Tyrell and Cersei
      Lannister,</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But Sansa, she
      didn't have any such love interests. I mean, obviously, I was shipping her with Jon
      and everything. But there was no actual canonical basis for that on any
      level. I
      think it's just a relief to see how... Because to me, it's almost like a moment of
      such growth, is what I felt, when I felt Sansa. Because when you're young,
      [inaudible 01:20:56]. You want the perfect marriage, and
      the perfect husband, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't mean that
      you'll necessarily get it. And to me, at least, growing up is balancing those
      childhood desires, and those childhood needs with whatever you learn as you grow up.
      And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
      child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
      sure that nobody hurt her. And I think
      there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
      liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
      everything. And, obviously, there's a ton of other problems. How [inaudible
      01:21:42] Daenerys, and Cersei, and Jaime. And a number of other characters.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
      don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
      came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
      into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
      ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that. "Okay, well, let's just do Korra next,"
      because I was pretty sure
      that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
      of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
      of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
      watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it. I was very
      much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
      and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
      style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality. And
      then, just
      seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
      once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
      not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
      the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
      there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
      Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
      super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
      of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
      relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
      should take five steps back, and let's just
      focus on these two.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> That was
      Christmas break, but my grandma was staying over for the weekend, so I had to watch
      it silently at like midnight, and freak out quietly. As soon as Asami showed up on
      the screen, I must have lost
      it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
      happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
      different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
      know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
      way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
      So, I tried to mix it up on occasion. And
      okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
      notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
      figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
      she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
      Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
      things stand out immediately. Even in the modern drabbles, or the
      other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
      she can access that. And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
      gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
      age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
      she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
      life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
      all the time. I loved that. Even if, and I think
      once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
      maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
      to see
      that, but I liked that they
      weren't immediate, for the most part. They wanted to be friends first, but they were
      so good together that I wanted to be able to
      sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes. Things like that, you notice
      immediately, but also that
      it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
      I
      don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
      trying to get portrayed.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
      was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
      possible love interests. Tahno was just a bully that people decide ... I don't
      understand why people like that, but people do. So, we spend four seasons developing
      Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
      lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
      out  immediately after
      the season finale aired, everyone was sort of unsure like, "This is canon, right?
      This is canon. That's what this looks
      like," "Korrasami's canon. That's
      what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
      up to that point, there really hadn't been
      a whole lot of huge representation for female ships. So, these big cartoons that are
      for kids are doing more
      for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
      kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
      much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust." So, to
      see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
      god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
      have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it was also good that
      nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
      communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
      white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
      frankly.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At the time that the
      show was airing, it
      was kind of taboo for divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare
      for a widower to be portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife
      that he had lost, so it was a combination of really interesting
      things. And because
      I grew up in a country where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian
      content was part of our regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened,
      so it shaped what I was interested in.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I was on Twitter casually
      scrolling through something, and someone from back home happened to mention how the
      finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background and
      the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
      that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
      Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
      I
      could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
      been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
      how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way. But also the
      fics I had read after the show had finished
      seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ... Obviously, it was a
      really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had happened in the gap
      years that they hadn't shown us for Korra. I kind of wanted to see
      that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular, and this was surprising
      for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I never really remember to
      think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like there was this big gap
      available to us for exploration.  So I kind
      of wanted to explore that and see how Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for
      me I like to see how the characters are responding to what's happening to them
      rather than having the plot happen to them, and with Asami there was just so much
      room to do that.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
      came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
      that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened. Whereas, for Asami,
      Asami
      didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have anyone. So she
      went back to someone, I guess who is an ... I
      wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic for them. But in the way
      that the relationship shifts from love and care to an act of violence
      ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore that. It's just
      fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow still find a way
      to
      circle back around to the people who have hurt them.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think in the first two
      books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I guess her experiences
      are fantastical in a sense. It was sort of ... To me, it
      was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is this
      all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having this
      really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once had,
      and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to deal
      with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so forth. I don't
      know, it just ... There may have been other works of
      fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that was when Korra
      just seemed more human.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular, I think it's fascinating
      that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all these really powerful girl
      and women characters who were, for the most part, respected, at least in later
      years. Because when we first meet the Avatar world, we know
      that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all this power, she's in this
      position where she could eventually have the throne, she isn't respected by her own
      father. And I
      think I'd actually forgotten about this until someone else had written it in their
      own fan fiction, which is part of what's so fun about reading fan fiction. There are
      all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on right away, but someone else mentions
      it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the world and look at it from a different
      angle. But even Katara in the
      beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use waterbending beyond
      healing, and she goes on to become one of the greatest
      waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have this really
      powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends someone who is,
      up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more ruthless and so
      forth. So it was interesting to see all
      these female characters get to be complex and powerful and not have that held
      against them, unless you count Azula and how that ended for
      her.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But it was nice to see the LOK universe expand upon that and show
      us that things had changed in some ways. For one, we have Korra, who is the avatar,
      and she is this figure who
      is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity that we're
      accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants without
      concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think about her
      gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering herself
      inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this particular
      form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin and we see
      Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or they're
      dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with their
      mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well, if
      they do have children, and so forth. I don't know. It was an
      example of how that world had changed or was changing possibly for the
      better.</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
      actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
      how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
      how she had gotten to living with Jaime. I just find their relationship in
      canon to be so interesting because it was one of
      the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
      pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
      surprised. Brienne was what a lot of
      these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
      places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
      and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
      of her issues with not being able
      to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
      heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
      always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
      gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable There's a lot
      of, again, fan fic already out there of
      them being intimate, but it was all
      very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
      vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
      I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
      own instead.</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
      he always had a very strange affinity, but
      like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
      loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
      of view. I think he definitely
      is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
      means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
      it.</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
      reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
      very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
      and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit. I wanted something similar, but
      would still
      make me feel like that, but wanted to make it more intimate and feel like it was
      still just as opening, but with actions and not just with words. trying to work through
      gender things. I
      wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
      their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
      that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
      work through those emotions with me.</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, it's depressingly small. I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
      less fan fic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
      unique friendship/relationship as like a side note, I think the show really undercut
      Jaime and Brienne's
      relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
      kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her. I was
      like, "Boy is a head shorter than her." That was part of the appeal was that Jaime
      had this big, beautiful wife that was taller than him
      and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
      wonderful?" That was part of what made it so enjoyable a lot of
      the fics, even with Jaime and Brienne is just depressingly, like, "Wow, if I
      wanted to read this fic, I'd just go to like any romance section and find
      it."</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think that bit of the
      ending, was actually the one I had the least amount of problems with, out of all of
      it because its part of the King's guard. This was like an ideal kind of took Jaime's
      spot in like the head. I mean, personally, I think the whole bit where he leaves and
      comes
      back is bullshit. Like, I'm sorry, I can't even mince words with that</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I knew everything that was going to
      happen until about Season Four. And was perfectly happy with it, really wasn't
      paying any attention. So, right when about Season
      Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
      Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
      no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
      brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
      thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
      wrote a Game of Thrones fan fiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
      series, the first one.</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually liked
      Sandor Clegane, Sansa Stark as a pairing, whether it's through platonic, whether
      it's romantic, et cetera. It was just one of those good ones. I thought they had
      good scene chemistry together.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Canon Relation</h3>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First of all I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it,
      as a writer. I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's
      beneficial or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it
      now, but I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy.
      I know I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized,
      and I didn't say that obviously in the tags. But I also struggled because I didn't
      know how to write about my own trauma, and so I tried to write about trauma in ways
      that other people were experiencing it. And already the text engaged with that, and
      those weren't really authentic to me. They weren't things I was writing about at the
      time. It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love
      story about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not
      make those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and
      I couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing
      I was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
      I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
      but it felt more like a nod than a full  There are things I don't like about it, but
      I like it as a little bit of text. It's there in the text, it was one of those things
      that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love feeling represented." So I wrote that. I chose
      the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading a...
      I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
      different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
      in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
      and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
      looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that this is a piece that comes from a weird part of what I understood about
      that world. To me, Korra grows up in a compound with people who are older than her,
      who aren't likely to tell her the truth about things. Because the White Lotus is an
      organization of people who are fundamentally keeping her apart. And I remember being
      like, "Oh, these folks are not going to tell a child about queer sexuality." Particularly
      sexuality is a hard topic, you grow up in that kind of compound in a world where queer
      identities are looked down on, you're going to come away with this very strange view
      about that. And you might just be told nothing. I think of a place I was there, and
      this was particularly...I was engaging with political institutions at the time that
      were much, much bigger than me, particularly family institutions. My family was pretty
      chill, but running a queer resource center at community college is like, getting that
      [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of people that were writing about
      the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't talk about it, or being the
      only source of information, of being part of an institution that was the only source
      of information.</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
      the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
      Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
      film." So, the
      person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
      universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending. So then I realized
      that Jodhaa Akbar, which is
      definitely a Desi film, had a wonderful set of characters that was definitely
      angsty, but had a wonderfully happy ending. And allowed me to write about something
      that was kind of dear to my heart as well. Because it was a Desi film. It was one
      representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
      those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
      to bridge them. Because you have to. Because it's not just
      about love, or it's not just about anything. It's about your pride, it's about your
      family's livelihood. All of those kind of come together, you have to do it. You
      don't want to, but, somehow, you have to. I think it's that gritting of your teeth,
      and getting on with life that kind of really draws me in.</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean that I just don't think I relate to him at the
      same extent that I relate to Sansa.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I hate that I did it, but I did real-person
      fanfiction for Paramore. Thinking of it now, it's always like, "God, that's not
      good. I shouldn't have done it, but here we are." And from those three, you can see
      that they have
      very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
      queer
      characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
      go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
      their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
      situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
      don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
      came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
      into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
      ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that. "Okay, well, let's just do Korra next,"
      because I was pretty sure
      that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
      of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
      of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
      watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it. I was very
      much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
      and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
      style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality. And
      then, just
      seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
      once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
      not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
      the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
      there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
      Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
      super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
      of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
      relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
      should take five steps back, and let's just
      focus on these two.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
      only get a certain amount of them in canon. So, it's kind of just how I always
      imagined her parents were just going to always be there for her. And we do see that
      in season three, where she's immediately going to bat for them and each
      other. So, at the same time,
      it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
      since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
      until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
      a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
      decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
      this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
      case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
      Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
      bit. So, I just tried to stay true to that, I guess, in some
      regard, as far as her relationship went.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
      was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
      possible love interests. Tahno was just a bully that people decide ... I don't
      understand why people like that, but people do. So, we spend four seasons developing
      Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
      lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
      out  immediately after
      the season finale aired, everyone was sort of unsure like, "This is canon, right?
      This is canon. That's what this looks
      like," "Korrasami's canon. That's
      what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
      up to that point, there really hadn't been
      a whole lot of huge representation for female ships. So, these big cartoons that are
      for kids are doing more
      for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
      kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
      much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust." So, to
      see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
      god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
      have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
      watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
      because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
      and so on. So I got into forums and fans would translate for
      those of us who didn't speak Hindi. And obviously people would
      answer questions if you asked because you couldn't get everything in the
      translations or the summaries. And during that time, we would talk about the plot
      of
      the show, what the characters were doing, where we were expecting things to go at
      that time. It was just a lot of the basic things at fandom.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At the time that the
      show was airing, it
      was kind of taboo for divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare
      for a widower to be portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife
      that he had lost, so it was a combination of really interesting
      things. And because
      I grew up in a country where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian
      content was part of our regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened,
      so it shaped what I was interested in.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I think with Twilight
      it was just that phase where you finally find a story that speaks to you, even if
      you kind of hate it when you look back at it when you're older. But at the time, how
      Bella was written both as someone who was
      insular and chooses to form or has a small community and so forth and deals with
      depression or whatever it is, it just seemed to be something
      that I could relate to. I think I stumbled
      upon those ... I can't think of what it's called, the English variety, because I did
      stumble upon it in my time in the Indian fan fictions and it was called something
      slightly different. But basically where you would participate with one fan writing
      a
      line, the next fan writing another line and so on and so forth. So that was the
      first time that I actually wrote anything fandom related.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I am
      currently in the Supergirl fandom, which has been a mess. I'm saying that
      nicely. I think it was more that it was
      very books for me because I
      grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on South America but as socially, politically
      part of the Caribbean, so most of the content that we were consuming was either
      shows from the US or whatever, maybe European shows might have filtered through,
      and that also was the case for the books that we were reading. And while it was
      the case within school for us to consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to
      read Caribbean literature as a person on my own. So it was just discovering a collection
      of books in my own home from my aunt and my mother and so on, their teachers.
      And my aunt in particular,
      she teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
      them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
      were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
      know. I guess it comes back to not knowing what you're missing
      until you finally have it. So when I first read texts were people were actually talking
      about foods that I
      would eat or where people were living in communities like mine, where people
      spoke that way that I spoke, et cetera.
      Because even though I speak, let's say, like this,
      how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back home, it's a
      little different even though ... So, my particular country, we speak English,
      but it's a particular kind of English. So just seeing that in
      text and then realizing that the fantasies and so on that I was consuming were ...
      I
      don't know, it had these strange things that just didn't quite compute with where
      I
      was living. That's where it really clicked for me. And from that point onward, I
      think that's where I began to see it in everything else. The biggest shift didn't
      really come until I moved to the US,
      because back home I
      was part of the majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing
      yourself in other ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in
      the news as a politician, et cetera. But here it was a completely different
      ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think in the first two
      books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I guess her experiences
      are fantastical in a sense. It was sort of ... To me, it
      was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is this
      all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having this
      really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once had,
      and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to deal
      with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so forth. I don't
      know, it just ... There may have been other works of
      fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that was when Korra
      just seemed more human.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korra
      gets to her lowest point.  The implication is
      that she's about to jump off a cliff. But we don't really get to dwell in the
      true feeling of that moment, the have to fix it immediately because of the idea
      that the show may never get to come back to this point, so we don't get to
      actually see what that means for her. we see Korra actual deal, for more than one
      episode, with how she's effected by these things, and to me that was
      different. You
      actually get to see an avatar. And yes, Aang did deal with this too, but it's ...
      I
      don't know. It's just different for me. Deal
      with PTSD and depression and just all these changing things. It
      was interesting.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think I was
      both going for an understanding of how Asami herself is effected by this really
      terrible thing we see happen to Korra. everyone has seen someone who they think is
      all-powerful and
      infallible, invulnerable to an extent, be ... I don't want to say broken, but be injured
      in a really drastic way and them not
      being able to do anything much to help with her recovery in concrete
      ways. But the imagery
      also for that chapter was, I guess, built in subtext because I wasn't quite sure yet
      how to engage with what was happening
      in ways that were visible to other people outside of the fan community, the
      slashfan community.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I'm like, "In what
      world am I supposed to view this as platonic? I mean, I know I was raised in a pretty
      fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing here things
      that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
      00:58:53] people." So that's when I became a
      believer. And the longer I watched the show, the more it seemed to grow. And you could
      tell, from a fandom perspective, some people
      who are cishet won't be able to speak to this, but you could
      tell that the writer's room was split in how they were portraying the characters
      because I think they got
      uncomfortable with how fandom was growing so rapidly and intensely around these
      two characters, even to the
      point where they used the black character as a wedge between
      them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
      in that show. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Canon Critique</h3>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
      I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
      but it felt more like a nod than a full  There are things I don't like about it, but
      I like it as a little bit of text. It's there in the text, it was one of those things
      that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love feeling represented." So I wrote that. I chose
      the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading a...
      I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
      different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
      in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
      and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
      looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
   <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
      a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
      but it's good. Also I think it's when fiction ends, it does draw people who are like,
      "Oh, I want to write more on this subject, I want to play with these concepts again."
      There's also a distinct un-ended-ness I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration
      is limited, is kind of bad. But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where
      it's like, they just want to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did
      see them agree, yeah I want to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this,
      it's healthy. I love that! I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage
      with.[inaudible 00:47:08] what are other ways we can imagine it? And that creates
      fanon, which means you get this whole long space of people being like, "Oh yeah, I
      am writing about this content of fanon in this alternate universe, I'm going to write
      a piece about a radio show It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of
      [inaudible 00:47:39], some of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion
      that comes out of that. So I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and
      I think that it's liberating for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah, I mean, I think
      when I was first getting into the fandom,
      one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
      strong. And it's true to a great extent. But I think what's
      even more fascinating to me, is how a lot of them tend to show that strength in so
      many different ways. Like, you have Sansa, who
      is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
      of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
      conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
      world. And then you have people like Margaery Tyrell and Cersei
      Lannister,</li>
   <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But Sansa, she
      didn't have any such love interests. I mean, obviously, I was shipping her with Jon
      and everything. But there was no actual canonical basis for that on any
      level. I
      think it's just a relief to see how... Because to me, it's almost like a moment of
      such growth, is what I felt, when I felt Sansa. Because when you're young,
      [inaudible 01:20:56]. You want the perfect marriage, and
      the perfect husband, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't mean that
      you'll necessarily get it. And to me, at least, growing up is balancing those
      childhood desires, and those childhood needs with whatever you learn as you grow up.
      And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
      child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
      sure that nobody hurt her. And I think
      there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
      liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
      everything. And, obviously, there's a ton of other problems. How [inaudible
      01:21:42] Daenerys, and Cersei, and Jaime. And a number of other characters.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
      don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
      came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
      into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
      ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that. "Okay, well, let's just do Korra next,"
      because I was pretty sure
      that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
      of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
      of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
      watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it. I was very

      then, just
      seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
      once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
      not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
      the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
      there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
      Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
      super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
      of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
      relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
      should take five steps back, and let's just
      focus on these two.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> That was
      Christmas break, but my grandma was staying over for the weekend, so I had to watch
      it silently at like midnight, and freak out quietly. As soon as Asami showed up on
      the screen, I must have lost
      it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
      happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
      different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
      know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
      way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
      So, I tried to mix it up on occasion. And
      okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
      notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
      figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
      she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
      Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
      things stand out immediately. Even in the modern drabbles, or the
      other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
      she can access that. And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
      gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
      age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
      she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
      life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
      all the time. I loved that. Even if, and I think
      once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
      maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
      to see
      that, but I liked that they
      weren't immediate, for the most part. They wanted to be friends first, but they were
      so good together that I wanted to be able to
      sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes. Things like that, you notice
      immediately, but also that
      it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
      I
      don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
      trying to get portrayed.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
      was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
      possible love interests. Tahno was just a bully that people decide ... I don't
      understand why people like that, but people do. So, we spend four seasons developing

      god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
      have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
   <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it was also good that
      nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
      communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
      white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
      frankly.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At the time that the
      show was airing, it
      was kind of taboo for divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare
      for a widower to be portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife

   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I was on Twitter casually
      scrolling through something, and someone from back home happened to mention how the
      finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background and
      the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
      that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
      Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
      I
      could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
      been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
      how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way. But also the
      fics I had read after the show had finished
      seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ... Obviously, it was a
      really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had happened in the gap
      years that they hadn't shown us for Korra. I kind of wanted to see
      that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular, and this was surprising
      for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I never really remember to
      think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like there was this big gap
      available to us for exploration.  So I kind
      of wanted to explore that and see how Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for
      me I like to see how the characters are responding to what's happening to them
      rather than having the plot happen to them, and with Asami there was just so much
      room to do that.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
      came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
      that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened. Whereas, for Asami,
      Asami
      didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have anyone. So she
      went back to someone, I guess who is an ... I
      wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic for them. But in the way
      that the relationship shifts from love and care to an act of violence
      ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore that. It's just
      fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow still find a way
      to
      circle back around to the people who have hurt them.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think in the first two
      books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I guess her experiences
      are fantastical in a sense. It was sort of ... To me, it
      was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is this
      all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having this
      really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once had,
      and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to deal
      with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so forth. I don't
      know, it just ... There may have been other works of
      fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that was when Korra
      just seemed more human.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular, I think it's fascinating
      that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all these really powerful girl
      and women characters who were, for the most part, respected, at least in later
      years. Because when we first meet the Avatar world, we know
      that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all this power, she's in this
      position where she could eventually have the throne, she isn't respected by her own
      father. And I
      think I'd actually forgotten about this until someone else had written it in their
      own fan fiction, which is part of what's so fun about reading fan fiction. There are
      all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on right away, but someone else mentions
      it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the world and look at it from a different
      angle. But even Katara in the
      beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use waterbending beyond
      healing, and she goes on to become one of the greatest
      waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have this really
      powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends someone who is,
      up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more ruthless and so
      forth. So it was interesting to see all
      these female characters get to be complex and powerful and not have that held
      against them, unless you count Azula and how that ended for
      her.</li>
   <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But it was nice to see the LOK universe expand upon that and show
      us that things had changed in some ways. For one, we have Korra, who is the avatar,
      and she is this figure who
      is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity that we're
      accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants without
      concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think about her
      gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering herself
      inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this particular
      form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin and we see
      Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or they're
      dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with their
      mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well, if
      they do have children, and so forth. I don't know. It was an
      example of how that world had changed or was changing possibly for the
      better.</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
      actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
      how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
      how she had gotten to living with Jaime. I just find their relationship in
      canon to be so interesting because it was one of
      the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
      pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
      surprised. Brienne was what a lot of
      these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
      places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
      and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
      of her issues with not being able
      to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
      heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
      always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
      gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable There's a lot
      of, again, fan fic already out there of
      them being intimate, but it was all
      very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
      vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
      I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
      own instead.</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
      he always had a very strange affinity, but
      like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
      loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
      of view. I think he definitely
      is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
      means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
      it.</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
      reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
      very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
      and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit. I wanted something similar, but
      would still
      make me feel like that, but wanted to make it more intimate and feel like it was
      still just as opening, but with actions and not just with words. trying to work through
      gender things. I
      wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
      their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
      that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
      work through those emotions with me.</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, it's depressingly small. I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
      less fan fic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
      unique friendship/relationship as like a side note, I think the show really undercut
      Jaime and Brienne's
      relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
      kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her. I was
      like, "Boy is a head shorter than her." That was part of the appeal was that Jaime
      had this big, beautiful wife that was taller than him
      and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
      wonderful?" That was part of what made it so enjoyable a lot of
      the fics, even with Jaime and Brienne is just depressingly, like, "Wow, if I
      wanted to read this fic, I'd just go to like any romance section and find
      it."</li>
   <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think that bit of the
      ending, was actually the one I had the least amount of problems with, out of all of
      it because its part of the King's guard. This was like an ideal kind of took Jaime's
      spot in like the head. I mean, personally, I think the whole bit where he leaves and
      comes
      back is bullshit. Like, I'm sorry, I can't even mince words with that</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I knew everything that was going to
      happen until about Season Four. And was perfectly happy with it, really wasn't
      paying any attention. So, right when about Season
      Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
      Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
      no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
      brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
      thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
      wrote a Game of Thrones fan fiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
      series, the first one.</li>
   <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually liked
      Sandor Clegane, Sansa Stark as a pairing, whether it's through platonic, whether
      it's romantic, et cetera. It was just one of those good ones. I thought they had
      good scene chemistry together.</li>

  <h3>Canon Compliment</h3>
  <ul>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
        I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
        but it felt more like a nod than a full  There are things I don't like about it, but
        I like it as a little bit of text. It's there in the text, it was one of those things
        that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love feeling represented." So I wrote that. I chose
        the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading a...
        I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
        different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
        in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
        and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
        looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
        a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
        but it's good. Also I think it's when fiction ends, it does draw people who are like,
        "Oh, I want to write more on this subject, I want to play with these concepts again."
        There's also a distinct un-ended-ness I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration
        is limited, is kind of bad. But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where
        it's like, they just want to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did
        see them agree, yeah I want to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this,
        it's healthy. I love that! I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage
        with.[inaudible 00:47:08] what are other ways we can imagine it? And that creates
        fanon, which means you get this whole long space of people being like, "Oh yeah, I
        am writing about this content of fanon in this alternate universe, I'm going to write
        a piece about a radio show It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of
        [inaudible 00:47:39], some of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion
        that comes out of that. So I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and
        I think that it's liberating for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah, I mean, I think
        when I was first getting into the fandom,
        one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
        strong. And it's true to a great extent. But I think what's
        even more fascinating to me, is how a lot of them tend to show that strength in so
        many different ways. Like, you have Sansa, who
        is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
        of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
        conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
        world. And then you have people like Margaery Tyrell and Cersei
        Lannister,</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But Sansa, she
        didn't have any such love interests. I mean, obviously, I was shipping her with Jon
        and everything. But there was no actual canonical basis for that on any
        level. I
        think it's just a relief to see how... Because to me, it's almost like a moment of
        such growth, is what I felt, when I felt Sansa. Because when you're young,
        [inaudible 01:20:56]. You want the perfect marriage, and
        the perfect husband, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't mean that
        you'll necessarily get it. And to me, at least, growing up is balancing those
        childhood desires, and those childhood needs with whatever you learn as you grow up.
        And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
        child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
        sure that nobody hurt her. And I think
        there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
        liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
        everything. And, obviously, there's a ton of other problems. How [inaudible
        01:21:42] Daenerys, and Cersei, and Jaime. And a number of other characters.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
        don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
        came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
        into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
        ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that. "Okay, well, let's just do Korra next,"
        because I was pretty sure
        that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
        of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
        of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
        watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it. I was very
        much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
        and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
        style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality. And
        then, just
        seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
        once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
        not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
        the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
        there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
        Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
        super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
        of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
        relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
        should take five steps back, and let's just
        focus on these two.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> That was
        Christmas break, but my grandma was staying over for the weekend, so I had to watch
        it silently at like midnight, and freak out quietly. As soon as Asami showed up on
        the screen, I must have lost
        it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
        happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
        different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
        know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
        way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
        So, I tried to mix it up on occasion. And
        okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
        notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
        figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
        she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
        Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
        things stand out immediately. Even in the modern drabbles, or the
        other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
        she can access that. And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
        gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
        age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
        she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
        life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
        all the time. I loved that. Even if, and I think
        once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
        maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
        to see
        that, but I liked that they
        weren't immediate, for the most part. They wanted to be friends first, but they were
        so good together that I wanted to be able to
        sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes. Things like that, you notice
        immediately, but also that
        it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
        I
        don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
        trying to get portrayed.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
        was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
        possible love interests. Tahno was just a bully that people decide ... I don't
        understand why people like that, but people do. So, we spend four seasons developing
        Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
        lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
        out  immediately after
        the season finale aired, everyone was sort of unsure like, "This is canon, right?
        This is canon. That's what this looks
        like," "Korrasami's canon. That's
        what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
        up to that point, there really hadn't been
        a whole lot of huge representation for female ships. So, these big cartoons that are
        for kids are doing more
        for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
        kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
        much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust." So, to
        see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
        god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
        have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it was also good that
        nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
        communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
        white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
        frankly.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At the time that the
        show was airing, it
        was kind of taboo for divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare
        for a widower to be portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife
        that he had lost, so it was a combination of really interesting
        things. And because
        I grew up in a country where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian
        content was part of our regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened,
        so it shaped what I was interested in.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I was on Twitter casually
        scrolling through something, and someone from back home happened to mention how the
        finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background and
        the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
        that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
        Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
        I
        could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
        been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
        how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way. But also the
        fics I had read after the show had finished
        seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ... Obviously, it was a
        really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had happened in the gap
        years that they hadn't shown us for Korra. I kind of wanted to see
        that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular, and this was surprising
        for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I never really remember to
        think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like there was this big gap
        available to us for exploration.  So I kind
        of wanted to explore that and see how Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for
        me I like to see how the characters are responding to what's happening to them
        rather than having the plot happen to them, and with Asami there was just so much
        room to do that.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
        came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
        that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened. Whereas, for Asami,
        Asami
        didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have anyone. So she
        went back to someone, I guess who is an ... I
        wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic for them. But in the way
        that the relationship shifts from love and care to an act of violence
        ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore that. It's just
        fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow still find a way
        to
        circle back around to the people who have hurt them.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think in the first two
        books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I guess her experiences
        are fantastical in a sense. It was sort of ... To me, it
        was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is this
        all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having this
        really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once had,
        and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to deal
        with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so forth. I don't
        know, it just ... There may have been other works of
        fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that was when Korra
        just seemed more human.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular, I think it's fascinating
        that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all these really powerful girl
        and women characters who were, for the most part, respected, at least in later
        years. Because when we first meet the Avatar world, we know
        that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all this power, she's in this
        position where she could eventually have the throne, she isn't respected by her own
        father. And I
        think I'd actually forgotten about this until someone else had written it in their
        own fan fiction, which is part of what's so fun about reading fan fiction. There are
        all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on right away, but someone else mentions
        it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the world and look at it from a different
        angle. But even Katara in the
        beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use waterbending beyond
        healing, and she goes on to become one of the greatest
        waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have this really
        powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends someone who is,
        up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more ruthless and so
        forth. So it was interesting to see all
        these female characters get to be complex and powerful and not have that held
        against them, unless you count Azula and how that ended for
        her.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But it was nice to see the LOK universe expand upon that and show
        us that things had changed in some ways. For one, we have Korra, who is the avatar,
        and she is this figure who
        is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity that we're
        accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants without
        concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think about her
        gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering herself
        inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this particular
        form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin and we see
        Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or they're
        dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with their
        mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well, if
        they do have children, and so forth. I don't know. It was an
        example of how that world had changed or was changing possibly for the
        better.</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
        actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
        how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
        how she had gotten to living with Jaime. I just find their relationship in
        canon to be so interesting because it was one of
        the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
        pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
        surprised. Brienne was what a lot of
        these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
        places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
        and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
        of her issues with not being able
        to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
        heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
        always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
        gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable There's a lot
        of, again, fan fic already out there of
        them being intimate, but it was all
        very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
        vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
        I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
        own instead.</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
        he always had a very strange affinity, but
        like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
        loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
        of view. I think he definitely
        is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
        means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
        it.</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
        reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
        very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
        and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit. I wanted something similar, but
        would still
        make me feel like that, but wanted to make it more intimate and feel like it was
        still just as opening, but with actions and not just with words. trying to work through
        gender things. I
        wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
        their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
        that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
        work through those emotions with me.</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, it's depressingly small. I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
        less fan fic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
        unique friendship/relationship as like a side note, I think the show really undercut
        Jaime and Brienne's
        relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
        kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her. I was
        like, "Boy is a head shorter than her." That was part of the appeal was that Jaime
        had this big, beautiful wife that was taller than him
        and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
        wonderful?" That was part of what made it so enjoyable a lot of
        the fics, even with Jaime and Brienne is just depressingly, like, "Wow, if I
        wanted to read this fic, I'd just go to like any romance section and find
        it."</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think that bit of the
        ending, was actually the one I had the least amount of problems with, out of all of
        it because its part of the King's guard. This was like an ideal kind of took Jaime's
        spot in like the head. I mean, personally, I think the whole bit where he leaves and
        comes
        back is bullshit. Like, I'm sorry, I can't even mince words with that</li>
     <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I knew everything that was going to
        happen until about Season Four. And was perfectly happy with it, really wasn't
        paying any attention. So, right when about Season
        Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
        Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
        no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
        brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
        thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
        wrote a Game of Thrones fan fiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
        series, the first one.</li>
     <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually liked
        Sandor Clegane, Sansa Stark as a pairing, whether it's through platonic, whether
        it's romantic, et cetera. It was just one of those good ones. I thought they had
        good scene chemistry together.</li>

  <h3>Canon Relation</h3>
  <ul>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First of all I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it,
        as a writer. I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's
        beneficial or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it
        now, but I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy.
        I know I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized,
        and I didn't say that obviously in the tags. But I also struggled because I didn't
        know how to write about my own trauma, and so I tried to write about trauma in ways
        that other people were experiencing it. And already the text engaged with that, and
        those weren't really authentic to me. They weren't things I was writing about at the
        time. It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love
        story about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not
        make those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and
        I couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing
        I was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
        I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
        but it felt more like a nod than a full  There are things I don't like about it, but
        I like it as a little bit of text. It's there in the text, it was one of those things
        that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love feeling represented." So I wrote that. I chose
        the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading a...
        I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
        different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
        in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
        and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
        looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that this is a piece that comes from a weird part of what I understood about
        that world. To me, Korra grows up in a compound with people who are older than her,
        who aren't likely to tell her the truth about things. Because the White Lotus is an
        organization of people who are fundamentally keeping her apart. And I remember being
        like, "Oh, these folks are not going to tell a child about queer sexuality." Particularly
        sexuality is a hard topic, you grow up in that kind of compound in a world where queer
        identities are looked down on, you're going to come away with this very strange view
        about that. And you might just be told nothing. I think of a place I was there, and
        this was particularly...I was engaging with political institutions at the time that
        were much, much bigger than me, particularly family institutions. My family was pretty
        chill, but running a queer resource center at community college is like, getting that
        [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of people that were writing about
        the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't talk about it, or being the
        only source of information, of being part of an institution that was the only source
        of information.</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
        the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
        Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
        film." So, the
        person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
        universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending. So then I realized
        that Jodhaa Akbar, which is
        definitely a Desi film, had a wonderful set of characters that was definitely
        angsty, but had a wonderfully happy ending. And allowed me to write about something
        that was kind of dear to my heart as well. Because it was a Desi film. It was one
        representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
        those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
        to bridge them. Because you have to. Because it's not just
        about love, or it's not just about anything. It's about your pride, it's about your
        family's livelihood. All of those kind of come together, you have to do it. You
        don't want to, but, somehow, you have to. I think it's that gritting of your teeth,
        and getting on with life that kind of really draws me in.</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean that I just don't think I relate to him at the
        same extent that I relate to Sansa.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I hate that I did it, but I did real-person
        fanfiction for Paramore. Thinking of it now, it's always like, "God, that's not
        good. I shouldn't have done it, but here we are." And from those three, you can see
        that they have
        very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
        queer
        characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
        go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
        their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
        situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
        don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
        came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
        into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
        ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that. "Okay, well, let's just do Korra next,"
        because I was pretty sure
        that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
        of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
        of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
        watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it. I was very
        much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
        and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
        style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality. And
        then, just
        seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
        once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
        not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
        the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
        there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
        Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
        super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
        of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
        relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
        should take five steps back, and let's just
        focus on these two.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
        only get a certain amount of them in canon. So, it's kind of just how I always
        imagined her parents were just going to always be there for her. And we do see that
        in season three, where she's immediately going to bat for them and each
        other. So, at the same time,
        it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
        since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
        until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
        a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
        decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
        this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
        case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
        Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
        bit. So, I just tried to stay true to that, I guess, in some
        regard, as far as her relationship went.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
        was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
        possible love interests. Tahno was just a bully that people decide ... I don't
        understand why people like that, but people do. So, we spend four seasons developing
        Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
        lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
        out  immediately after
        the season finale aired, everyone was sort of unsure like, "This is canon, right?
        This is canon. That's what this looks
        like," "Korrasami's canon. That's
        what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
        up to that point, there really hadn't been
        a whole lot of huge representation for female ships. So, these big cartoons that are
        for kids are doing more
        for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
        kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
        much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust." So, to
        see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
        god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
        have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
        watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
        because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
        and so on. So I got into forums and fans would translate for
        those of us who didn't speak Hindi. And obviously people would
        answer questions if you asked because you couldn't get everything in the
        translations or the summaries. And during that time, we would talk about the plot
        of
        the show, what the characters were doing, where we were expecting things to go at
        that time. It was just a lot of the basic things at fandom.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At the time that the
        show was airing, it
        was kind of taboo for divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare
        for a widower to be portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife
        that he had lost, so it was a combination of really interesting
        things. And because
        I grew up in a country where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian
        content was part of our regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened,
        so it shaped what I was interested in.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I think with Twilight
        it was just that phase where you finally find a story that speaks to you, even if
        you kind of hate it when you look back at it when you're older. But at the time, how
        Bella was written both as someone who was
        insular and chooses to form or has a small community and so forth and deals with
        depression or whatever it is, it just seemed to be something
        that I could relate to. I think I stumbled
        upon those ... I can't think of what it's called, the English variety, because I did
        stumble upon it in my time in the Indian fan fictions and it was called something
        slightly different. But basically where you would participate with one fan writing
        a
        line, the next fan writing another line and so on and so forth. So that was the
        first time that I actually wrote anything fandom related.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I am
        currently in the Supergirl fandom, which has been a mess. I'm saying that
        nicely. I think it was more that it was
        very books for me because I
        grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on South America but as socially, politically
        part of the Caribbean, so most of the content that we were consuming was either
        shows from the US or whatever, maybe European shows might have filtered through,
        and that also was the case for the books that we were reading. And while it was
        the case within school for us to consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to
        read Caribbean literature as a person on my own. So it was just discovering a collection
        of books in my own home from my aunt and my mother and so on, their teachers.
        And my aunt in particular,
        she teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
        them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
        were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
        know. I guess it comes back to not knowing what you're missing
        until you finally have it. So when I first read texts were people were actually talking
        about foods that I
        would eat or where people were living in communities like mine, where people
        spoke that way that I spoke, et cetera.
        Because even though I speak, let's say, like this,
        how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back home, it's a
        little different even though ... So, my particular country, we speak English,
        but it's a particular kind of English. So just seeing that in
        text and then realizing that the fantasies and so on that I was consuming were ...
        I
        don't know, it had these strange things that just didn't quite compute with where
        I
        was living. That's where it really clicked for me. And from that point onward, I
        think that's where I began to see it in everything else. The biggest shift didn't
        really come until I moved to the US,
        because back home I
        was part of the majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing
        yourself in other ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in
        the news as a politician, et cetera. But here it was a completely different
        ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think in the first two
        books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I guess her experiences
        are fantastical in a sense. It was sort of ... To me, it
        was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is this
        all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having this
        really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once had,
        and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to deal
        with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so forth. I don't
        know, it just ... There may have been other works of
        fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that was when Korra
        just seemed more human.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korra
        gets to her lowest point.  The implication is
        that she's about to jump off a cliff. But we don't really get to dwell in the
        true feeling of that moment, the have to fix it immediately because of the idea
        that the show may never get to come back to this point, so we don't get to
        actually see what that means for her. we see Korra actual deal, for more than one
        episode, with how she's effected by these things, and to me that was
        different. You
        actually get to see an avatar. And yes, Aang did deal with this too, but it's ...
        I
        don't know. It's just different for me. Deal
        with PTSD and depression and just all these changing things. It
        was interesting.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think I was
        both going for an understanding of how Asami herself is effected by this really
        terrible thing we see happen to Korra. everyone has seen someone who they think is
        all-powerful and
        infallible, invulnerable to an extent, be ... I don't want to say broken, but be injured
        in a really drastic way and them not
        being able to do anything much to help with her recovery in concrete
        ways. But the imagery
        also for that chapter was, I guess, built in subtext because I wasn't quite sure yet
        how to engage with what was happening
        in ways that were visible to other people outside of the fan community, the
        slashfan community.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I'm like, "In what
        world am I supposed to view this as platonic? I mean, I know I was raised in a pretty
        fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing here things
        that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
        00:58:53] people." So that's when I became a
        believer. And the longer I watched the show, the more it seemed to grow. And you could
        tell, from a fandom perspective, some people
        who are cishet won't be able to speak to this, but you could
        tell that the writer's room was split in how they were portraying the characters
        because I think they got
        uncomfortable with how fandom was growing so rapidly and intensely around these
        two characters, even to the
        point where they used the black character as a wedge between
        them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
        in that show. </li>

  <h3>Canon Critique</h3>
  <ul>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
        I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
        but it felt more like a nod than a full  There are things I don't like about it, but
        I like it as a little bit of text. It's there in the text, it was one of those things
        that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love feeling represented." So I wrote that. I chose
        the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading a...
        I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
        different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
        in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
        and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
        looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
     <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
        a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
        but it's good. Also I think it's when fiction ends, it does draw people who are like,
        "Oh, I want to write more on this subject, I want to play with these concepts again."
        There's also a distinct un-ended-ness I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration
        is limited, is kind of bad. But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where
        it's like, they just want to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did
        see them agree, yeah I want to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this,
        it's healthy. I love that! I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage
        with.[inaudible 00:47:08] what are other ways we can imagine it? And that creates
        fanon, which means you get this whole long space of people being like, "Oh yeah, I
        am writing about this content of fanon in this alternate universe, I'm going to write
        a piece about a radio show It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of
        [inaudible 00:47:39], some of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion
        that comes out of that. So I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and
        I think that it's liberating for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah, I mean, I think
        when I was first getting into the fandom,
        one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
        strong. And it's true to a great extent. But I think what's
        even more fascinating to me, is how a lot of them tend to show that strength in so
        many different ways. Like, you have Sansa, who
        is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
        of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
        conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
        world. And then you have people like Margaery Tyrell and Cersei
        Lannister,</li>
     <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But Sansa, she
        didn't have any such love interests. I mean, obviously, I was shipping her with Jon
        and everything. But there was no actual canonical basis for that on any
        level. I
        think it's just a relief to see how... Because to me, it's almost like a moment of
        such growth, is what I felt, when I felt Sansa. Because when you're young,
        [inaudible 01:20:56]. You want the perfect marriage, and
        the perfect husband, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't mean that
        you'll necessarily get it. And to me, at least, growing up is balancing those
        childhood desires, and those childhood needs with whatever you learn as you grow up.
        And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
        child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
        sure that nobody hurt her. And I think
        there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
        liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
        everything. And, obviously, there's a ton of other problems. How [inaudible
        01:21:42] Daenerys, and Cersei, and Jaime. And a number of other characters.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
        don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
        came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
        into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
        ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that. "Okay, well, let's just do Korra next,"
        because I was pretty sure
        that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
        of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
        of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
        watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it. I was very
        much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
        and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
        style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality. And
        then, just
        seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
        once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
        not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
        the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
        there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
        Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
        super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
        of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
        relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
        should take five steps back, and let's just
        focus on these two.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> That was
        Christmas break, but my grandma was staying over for the weekend, so I had to watch
        it silently at like midnight, and freak out quietly. As soon as Asami showed up on
        the screen, I must have lost
        it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
        happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
        different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
        know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
        way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
        So, I tried to mix it up on occasion. And
        okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
        notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
        figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
        she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
        Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
        things stand out immediately. Even in the modern drabbles, or the
        other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
        she can access that. And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
        gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
        age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
        she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
        life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
        all the time. I loved that. Even if, and I think
        once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
        maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
        to see
        that, but I liked that they
        weren't immediate, for the most part. They wanted to be friends first, but they were
        so good together that I wanted to be able to
        sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes. Things like that, you notice
        immediately, but also that
        it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
        I
        don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
        trying to get portrayed.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
        was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
        possible love interests. Tahno was just a bully that people decide ... I don't
        understand why people like that, but people do. So, we spend four seasons developing
        Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
        lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
        out  immediately after
        the season finale aired, everyone was sort of unsure like, "This is canon, right?
        This is canon. That's what this looks
        like," "Korrasami's canon. That's
        what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
        up to that point, there really hadn't been
        a whole lot of huge representation for female ships. So, these big cartoons that are
        for kids are doing more
        for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
        kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
        much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust." So, to
        see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
        god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
        have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
     <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it was also good that
        nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
        communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
        white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
        frankly.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At the time that the
        show was airing, it
        was kind of taboo for divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare
        for a widower to be portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife
        that he had lost, so it was a combination of really interesting
        things. And because
        I grew up in a country where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian
        content was part of our regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened,
        so it shaped what I was interested in.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I was on Twitter casually
        scrolling through something, and someone from back home happened to mention how the
        finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background and
        the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
        that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
        Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
        I
        could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
        been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
        how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way. But also the
        fics I had read after the show had finished
        seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ... Obviously, it was a
        really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had happened in the gap
        years that they hadn't shown us for Korra. I kind of wanted to see
        that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular, and this was surprising
        for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I never really remember to
        think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like there was this big gap
        available to us for exploration.  So I kind
        of wanted to explore that and see how Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for
        me I like to see how the characters are responding to what's happening to them
        rather than having the plot happen to them, and with Asami there was just so much
        room to do that.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
        came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
        that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened. Whereas, for Asami,
        Asami
        didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have anyone. So she
        went back to someone, I guess who is an ... I
        wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic for them. But in the way
        that the relationship shifts from love and care to an act of violence
        ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore that. It's just
        fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow still find a way
        to
        circle back around to the people who have hurt them.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think in the first two
        books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I guess her experiences
        are fantastical in a sense. It was sort of ... To me, it
        was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is this
        all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having this
        really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once had,
        and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to deal
        with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so forth. I don't
        know, it just ... There may have been other works of
        fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that was when Korra
        just seemed more human.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular, I think it's fascinating
        that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all these really powerful girl
        and women characters who were, for the most part, respected, at least in later
        years. Because when we first meet the Avatar world, we know
        that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all this power, she's in this
        position where she could eventually have the throne, she isn't respected by her own
        father. And I
        think I'd actually forgotten about this until someone else had written it in their
        own fan fiction, which is part of what's so fun about reading fan fiction. There are
        all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on right away, but someone else mentions
        it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the world and look at it from a different
        angle. But even Katara in the
        beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use waterbending beyond
        healing, and she goes on to become one of the greatest
        waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have this really
        powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends someone who is,
        up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more ruthless and so
        forth. So it was interesting to see all
        these female characters get to be complex and powerful and not have that held
        against them, unless you count Azula and how that ended for
        her.</li>
     <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But it was nice to see the LOK universe expand upon that and show
        us that things had changed in some ways. For one, we have Korra, who is the avatar,
        and she is this figure who
        is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity that we're
        accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants without
        concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think about her
        gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering herself
        inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this particular
        form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin and we see
        Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or they're
        dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with their
        mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well, if
        they do have children, and so forth. I don't know. It was an
        example of how that world had changed or was changing possibly for the
        better.</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
        actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
        how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
        how she had gotten to living with Jaime. I just find their relationship in
        canon to be so interesting because it was one of
        the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
        pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
        surprised. Brienne was what a lot of
        these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
        places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
        and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
        of her issues with not being able
        to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
        heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
        always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
        gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable There's a lot
        of, again, fan fic already out there of
        them being intimate, but it was all
        very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
        vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
        I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
        own instead.</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
        he always had a very strange affinity, but
        like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
        loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
        of view. I think he definitely
        is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
        means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
        it.</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
        reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
        very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
        and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit. I wanted something similar, but
        would still
        make me feel like that, but wanted to make it more intimate and feel like it was
        still just as opening, but with actions and not just with words. trying to work through
        gender things. I
        wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
        their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
        that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
        work through those emotions with me.</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, it's depressingly small. I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
        less fan fic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
        unique friendship/relationship as like a side note, I think the show really undercut
        Jaime and Brienne's
        relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
        kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her. I was
        like, "Boy is a head shorter than her." That was part of the appeal was that Jaime
        had this big, beautiful wife that was taller than him
        and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
        wonderful?" That was part of what made it so enjoyable a lot of
        the fics, even with Jaime and Brienne is just depressingly, like, "Wow, if I
        wanted to read this fic, I'd just go to like any romance section and find
        it."</li>
     <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think that bit of the
        ending, was actually the one I had the least amount of problems with, out of all of
        it because its part of the King's guard. This was like an ideal kind of took Jaime's
        spot in like the head. I mean, personally, I think the whole bit where he leaves and
        comes
        back is bullshit. Like, I'm sorry, I can't even mince words with that</li>
     <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I knew everything that was going to
        happen until about Season Four. And was perfectly happy with it, really wasn't
        paying any attention. So, right when about Season
        Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
        Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
        no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
        brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
        thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
        wrote a Game of Thrones fan fiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
