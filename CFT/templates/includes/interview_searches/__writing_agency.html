 <ul>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
       have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
       in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
       I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
       convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
       arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I wrote a piece called Addict's Alchemy, which was a piece about...in terms of
       servicing some of the same things we're talking about today. It's a piece about about
       trauma... And it [inaudible 00:05:20], that this isn't obviously. It's a piece about
       trauma and it's a piece about, what does it mean... Really they're both pieces about
       what it means to be disabled.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
       context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
       very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
       you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
       original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
       through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
       and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
       with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
       get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
       you.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was coming into my own politically, I was becoming my own political individual in
       a way I hadn't been before. Like I had politics, but this is around the time that
       I'm really radicalized, and just me engaging with those contexts.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world
       and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting,"
       instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with
       it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's
       also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that
       I really was not before.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First of all I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it,
       as a writer. I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's
       beneficial or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it
       now, but I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy.
       I know I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized,
       and I didn't say that obviously in the tags.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
       I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
       already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
       weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
       about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
       those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and I
       couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing I
       was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because
       I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But that was the biggest bit of feedback I got was this conversation, and it helped
       a little bit.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then the last one's a content warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see
       homophobia. I can't not publish a story about homophobia.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
       I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
       but it felt more like a nod than a full</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
       there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
       feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
       a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
       different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
       in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
       and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
       looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of
       the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was
       more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll
       do alternate points of view."</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>but this is what I was doing with my life. I was on my way to running a queer resource
       center at a college, so I was doing the work of feeling the political implications
       of things in the world. And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about
       is to write about... Not just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia,
       not just homophobia, but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because
       this was the thing that was radicalizing me, [inaudible] is vile, because... And it
       was about violence, so I don't just mean violence as a method of resistance, I mean
       violence as a thing that people survive. Because that's what's radicalizing me at
       the time. And so I felt the need to wake up that in a sense.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't know if I thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought
       about it as a storytelling tool obviously that helps power [inaudible 00:17:00], not
       necessarily about the story if it makes sense. I wasn't telling you things that had
       happened in the past, to teach you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This
       is what's haunting the characters, this is what the characters can't escape from in
       a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you
       know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes sense.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It was a piece that was sufficiently about me that it would have been fun and helpful
       for a lot of people. But this, I think it was a good piece, it was a piece that was
       a whole other world to read</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political
       institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family
       institutions. My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community
       college is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of
       people that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't
       talk about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
       that was the only source of information.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was trying to write a story that engaged with trauma and felt authentic and didn't
       make trauma seem like the end of the world. Because the binary that's in a lot of
       literature is either like, "Oh, you either overcame trauma, or you are doomed to misery
       forever." And I was trying to find some middle ground, trying to tell a story that
       felt authentic.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
       her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
       Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
       is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
       dress herself.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to tell a story about connection. And I wanted to make it clear that when
       I'm telling the story, I think that even [inaudible 00:26:39] understands that it's
       not really about romance as much as it is about feeling connected in a genuine way
       to people, that that central theme, building a life worth living after injury, or
       after trauma, is finding an authentic realtionship with people.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And so Asami plays that role, being a person to whom Korra wants to relate, is thrilled
       to relate, is not scared, or she is a little bit scared to relate, but is she scared
       to relate in the way that she's scared to relate to other people.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
       progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
       man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
       and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
       said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
       understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
       woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
       This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
       institution itself.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>In the context of this piece, a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois
       radical is that I'm not going to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really
       have a sense of class politics at the time, or have the beginnings of that study.
       That's only beginning to be born</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to give a sense of what is the politics of the Northern Water Tribe? And
       I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water Tribe,
       or is not criminalized anymore. Also I wanted to say this is a different relationship.
       But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give
       up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>He's not particularly flawed, because he's willing to play this opportunistic political
       game. Because he's also capable of looking at his child and going, "Maybe I shouldn't
       do that." </li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I would also say a little bit about some of the research I'd read at the time, turns
       out the book I was reading at the time that claimed that knowing someone who was gay
       had a significant...Or not knowing someone who was gay, but engaging with someone
       who's gay on the topic of being gay helped significantly with changing someone's political
       views, or being willing to accept gay people. Turns out that one was actually wrong,
       like literally the person who put together that study cooked the book.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I also sort of wanted to talk... I sort of was thinking about the limits of the political
       and the [inaudible 00:35:57] of the political. You could do what, when and where,
       the idea that a politician can't really save the world. I don't know if I was all
       the way to, "We have to do it," yet, but I think I'm getting there.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was thinking about New York City around the times of the Stonewall Riots. This is
       where those politics come in. I was playing with, what does it mean... I was playing
       with, what's particularly violent political oppression? What are the limits of political
       oppression in a relatively liberal cosmopolitan society? Because I was getting that
       sense of, there's actually a whole lot of ways that political oppression can happen
       that I'd never even thought about at this point, and I was learning about that. So
       I was writing about this character as someone who's experiencing the limits of that
       political oppression. And this is actually one of the key storylines in my opinion,
       and it's ultimately a story about resistance to a kind of political oppression</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This was written obviously before Donald Trump becomes President, and I could see
       all sorts of things about reaction again. But I was seeing the reaction, I was scared.
       I don't know where I got this, there was something bad was coming. I knew that I had
       that sense of fear, so I was writing about... I guess writing a little bit about,
       how do we fight back when things get worse?</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I also learned that you have to be careful with how much to take on, and you have
       to be careful about what you're willing to prune, and you have to be ready to prune
       things. And you have to be ready to follow a story where it goes instead of trying
       to follow all the directions you ever imagined. Because if you try to follow a story
       in every direction you have, then it's going to die like this piece did. It's like,
       "I don't know how to integrate the story into itself anymore."</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I had a very close group of friends on Live Journal back
       in the early 2000s. That, I think, probably because I was a teenager. Perhaps this
       is because of all those reasons. But that kind of close-knittedness has never kind
       of shown up for me ever since. I think I tend to participate now on more, "Oh, this
       is really interesting for me. And this is really fascinating." And I'll go into it
       for the material as opposed to the friendships themselves.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Mostly to keep
       myself writing. Because, otherwise, I would just not publish those materials until
       it becomes, you know. It's basically sitting on my hard drive for years and years
       on
       end, and finally I get the opportunity and the motivation to publish them.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because,
       initially, it was definitely a very close-knit, just writing for friends and with
       friends.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I've also recently published work in Fleabag, which
       was one of the fandoms that I had to write for for my Yuletide assignment.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>There's a couple of things that you see that are kind of
       interesting, and then you kind of identify a certain actor, or a certain character
       that you kind of find interesting. And then jump from there to another.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yes. I think my most recent published fanfiction is a
       Percy Weasley, second person point of view, post canon. In which he is attempting
       to
       basically restructure his society by running on a platform of big structural change.
       Which might sound vaguely familiar.  But it was, I
       think, mostly due to the kind of deep rage that I was feeling over the entire
       Democratic Primaries over the past couple of months. And almost the past year.
       In which everything felt very much like a lot of talk, and not a lot of doing.
       And at some point, you need some catharsis. And kind of putting it out into
       fiction and seeing something changing. Or, not even seeing something changing.
       But seeing people trying to effect change, and willing to fight for that change
       felt very important to me. And basically that entire fanfic is kind of born out
       of that seething, massive, "I want to see something happening."
       And I will see it happen in fiction, if not in reality.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>was talking about that, and I felt like
       that was a really fascinating look into that psyche. And seeing how Fleabag and the
       Priest would meet up. And how they would be after having separated for 20, 30 years,
       coming back to see each other after they have had full lives apart, but somehow
       still wanting something more. Which, I think, it's definitely, kind of, for me, I
       am
       not old enough to be discussing 50 year old, 60 year old life plans. But my life
       path has never been very straight, or what I felt that it would be. Because when I
       was, what? 15, I probably thought I'd be an engineer. And then after that I thought
       I'd be a doctor. And then, suddenly, now I'm a lawyer. And I thought I'd be in the
       U.S., and I'm in India. And it's a very wildly divergent and strange life path for
       me. And that's only been over, what? 10 years, 10, 15 years. And I can't even
       imagine how that would be over 20, 30 years. And identifying that desire for home,
       and wanting people to be that. As opposed to a given area, or a given job, or
       anything like that, felt very poignant to me at that particular point in
       time.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one fic that I was relatively and very
       proud of. To be honest.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
       the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
       Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
       film."</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
       person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
       universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And if you're just starting from scratch, then it's
       difficult to create why two people would hate each other so much. I mean, you need
       to have that religious, and
       cultural, and those barriers in order for that to
       happen.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I mean, I think the
       choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
       setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
       trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
       for it.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
       view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
       you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
       of
       view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
       what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
       more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And that also came across to a lot of readers, is what
       they were telling me, at least. Because they felt like there was a lot more gravitas
       to the entire fic that you wouldn't see in a lot of my other
       fanfics.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that for
       the actual research it was not so much that I did it for this particular fanfic, as
       it was more that I love that era a lot. So, I had tended to research it before, as
       well. So, I had a lot of information that I kind of knew in colloquial terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I did
       not remember the exact way that he had died, so then I kind of went searching for
       that. And then, I mean, from there it kind of spiraled into researching other things
       and kind of reading up more about Akbar and more about Jodhaa. And I'm an avid
       research. I mean, that's what I do now.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Where I
       just didn't translate them into Rajput or Hindi words. Because I just use
       whatever I knew, because I speak Kannada at home. And that's
       another language entirely. And I was just running out of time, and I said, "You know
       what? No, I'll just handle it myself. And not translate it, and hope that nobody
       minds.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think a lot of the research and a lot of the material
       was just about identifying and pulling disparate ideas together that I knew.
       From either my own culture because, of course,
       this is partially my own culture. And also, the historical
       details of [inaudible 00:27:49].</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think that was what
       was very important to me, especially in this story, was puling it all together so
       that there weren't any open endings. And the research really, somehow, it helped in
       pulling that together.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I honestly expected nobody to do
       that. It's good to see that people are just as interested in a lot of it, in this
       stuff. You know?</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that the
       thing I wanted to keep in mind was that I was doing the research, but I was also not
       putting as much research into it as I probably should have if I wanted to make it
       historical fiction.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was literally
       just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
       as
       South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
       Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And that was one thing I wanted to be clear about.
       Because, yes, it was research. But I think I wanted to keep to the spirit of the
       movie, as well as the spirit of the A Song of Ice and Fire canon.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But when I was making the
       actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
       actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
       identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
       identify.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
       and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
       that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
       ideas from.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was really worried about how it
       would be perceived by the fandom, how it would be received by people even outside
       of
       the fandom.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one of the
       primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
       sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was
       really worried about it, actually. Because I spoke to a couple people before I
       published the fanfic. Because I was kind of worried about it, and I wasn't sure how
       it would be received.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I wasn't sure people would
       think that it was good enough. Because I was also combining both South Indian and
       North Indian tropes, to a
       certain extent. And those weren't necessarily very compatible. And there's a lot
       of history behind that and everything. And I wasn't entirely
       sure how people would perceive it.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But people were very kind about it. And I haven't
       actually gotten a single negative feedback on that fanfic to date.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And
       especially when she has that fight with Jon and she goes back home. And that was,
       I
       think, the point of catharsis. Because especially when you're looking at a lot of
       Indian mothers, and Indian
       women who get into marriages at a very young age. You have to deal with your
       husband's family, you have to deal with that entire kind of stigma. About you
       have to be the one to adjust and to compromise to a far greater extent than your
       husband. And all of these kind of had come together and had
       been marinating for a very long time. And I feel like Sansa, in this, was very much
       the product of that. Where she was
       just trying to fight it, she was such a perfect child in that culture. And then
       suddenly she has to kind of leave her culture behind. Or, not leave her culture
       behind, but adjust to a new culture. And she feels like she's
       being punished by her old one for no fault of her own. And all of it, kind of, her
       desperate unhappiness, her tensions with her mother were a big part of the fic, I
       think, for me.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong> And I was so
       worried. Because all of this was very close to my heart, and I did not want to have
       to deal with a lot of backlash, or feedback, or having to fight to say, "Well, I
       don't mean to be rude on any of these kinds of things." These are meant with respect
       and they're meant with love. And they're from a part of myself.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, with all of that in mind, the actual fandom
       response was absolutely wonderful, and absolutely, completely respectful. And none
       of my fears at all came to fruition.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because they were all so kind, and so respectful of the entire fic in
       general.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because that's what I keep feeling whenever I look back at
       it, was how I got almost consumed by the characters when I was writing them.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I
       didn't feel like I could end it with, "Oh, everybody has kids and they're all
       happy." Because that felt very weird, and kind of disjointed with the rest of the
       fic.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And
       in that Sansa can see ghosts. And throughout the entire fic, it's a long fic and
       everything, but one of the biggest issues for me was, how do I end this?</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But to me, it felt like it began with Jon and
       it had to end with Jon. And it had to end with him finally being triumphant, and
       finally being happy for his triumph at the end of this fanfic.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
       clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
       Jon is raised a Targaryen.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
       because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
       other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
       fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
       particular tag.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But then the cultural tensions stem almost entirely
       from the differences within their upbringing, I'm pretty sure. Within their
       families. And I mean, there are
       cultural differences within, I mean, people that I've grown up with in India,
       and people in the U.S. And even though you're living side by side, that doesn't
       necessarily mean that you have the same cultural background.
       And I think that's something that both of them don't understand. And both of them
       kind of try to understand slowly.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And if you're talking about other moments,
       like when Sansa wants to give Jon his name, and he asks her to read it out loud. I
       think that's another moment of compromise. Because as much as she's giving him the
       gift,
       she's also giving him his name. And she's stepping across her own cultural
       boundaries to help him with that, which Jon doesn't completely
       understand.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Especially the quote that you put up here,
       which refers to Sansa's eyes. Because that was a moment for me, I think, more than
       anything else.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
       that was something that even when you agree to a marriage, and even when you kind
       of
       accept that. Especially when you go into your husband's house, and if you're living
       with his parents and everything. It's a very difficult concept. And it's a very
       difficult idea. And adjusting to that
       is a huge, almost, culture shock to people.
       To any women, adjusting to that is
       difficult. No matter who it is, no matter where you're going.
       So, then, I mean, especially for Sansa, who needs to leave behind her entire family.
       And doesn't even know when she'll be able to go back. And has to go to a foreign country
       without any
       support, and any of her own traditions. She's the one that's upheld every single
       tradition she has ever done. And especially when you're looking at the Hindu
       culture, it's very difficult to uphold them.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, finally, she
       slowly starts to grow into that. She starts to give moments of peace. You know,
       she's kind of giving Jon gifts, and she's trying to bridge that gap. Because she
       also realizes that it's her life, too. Which, I think, is one of the biggest
       realizations that a lot of women have. Which is, "Yes, I'm miserable. I want you to
       be miserable. But how am I going
       to be miserable for?" You need to let some things go, you need to move on past
       the injustices... I need to move past the injustices that I have
       faced.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>The one quote that you picked out here, "You stand before your father, bedecked in
       gossamer and lace and silk, glass thick and shining in your hair." Because that was
       one that I actually remember. Because I initially put the word jewel, and jewels in
       the place of the word glass. But then I wanted it, for her, to feel that it was
       cheaper than the jewel. Even if she had them, they didn't matter to her. Because it
       was just glass.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>As if, her family... Or, she's feeling as if her family is not willing to give
       her as much as she is owed when she's going into a
       marriage.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Oh. I think I learned that people are far more
       understanding than I was giving them credit for, especially because I was so afraid
       about the reception.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But then, I also think that one of the major
       things that I learned was probably that some of the anger, it doesn't have to be a
       very you anger to be a very deep one. For it to seep into your writing. Because a
       lot of the time, especially when I'm writing angry stories and everything, they tend
       to be immediate. Like, "Okay, I'm very angry right now. And I want to have a fit.
       And I want to do it." But this was something that it had kind have been, I think,
       brewing for a very long time. And then suddenly the anger, and the angst, and the
       hurt, and the pain, all kind of came out. But at the same time, it was not just
       that. It was also about passing through that anger, and knowing that there is going
       to be someone at the end of it who's willing to accept you.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I hate that I did it, but I did real-person
       fanfiction for Paramore. Thinking of it now, it's always like, "God, that's not
       good. I shouldn't have done it, but here we are."</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
       very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
       queer
       characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
       go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
       their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
       situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I'm
       trying to write something that's original, and that's always a bit more of an
       endeavor than you expect it to be.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, it was definitely, when I first started it, it
       was, "Okay, well, I kind of just want to write, and I want to get better at writing,
       practicing it." I started it in college, and the professor I had at that time kept
       saying how, "If you want to get better at writing, you have to write 50,000 words,
       and then, you have to write another 50,000." "Really? All right. I'll just write,
       then. People will give me prompts and I'll just write those as they come in." And
       then, there were a lot of prompts that came in, surprisingly. I was able to stay
       consistent with it for, I want to say, two, three years.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's funny, going back to the original ones, the
       older ones at least, and reading those, because you sent me one. I think it was
       chapter 37 you mentioned in your email, and I went back and read it and I was like,
       "Oof, I could do this a lot better now, I hope."</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. Just, I wanted to get better at it, and people
       were really good at giving me things that I could easily do at work,</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I didn't necessarily want to
       do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to
       a
       point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
       each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
       all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
       can't."</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a couple that, I don't
       remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
       [inaudible 00:09:21] on purpose, so that it had to be
       like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
       that.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
       was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
       think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
       prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
       I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
       I can sort of tailor it to that,"</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
       a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
       always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
       at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
       art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
       it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
       person's mind."</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I like that a lot of people, I still get comments
       occasionally that are, "I've just gone through this whole thing," and you can do
       that.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I also like that you can sort of see a progression of
       how I wrote them and how my own skills have maybe, hopefully developed. And even
       just, it did end up being four years' worth of time</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
       been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
       And maybe, I think,
       during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
       different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
       strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, if there were some things where I'd write the
       original drabble, and then I might get three more immediate requests in my inbox for
       a sequel, or for, "Can I get a full length thing of this?" And I didn't necessarily
       have the time or energy, or just the inclination in some cases.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I would start to feel guilty, and sometimes
       would just push one out whether or not I felt it was up to par, even though I hoped
       it was.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I mean, most
       of it was positive, which was really good. If somebody really didn't like something,
       they didn't usually tell me. Or if they did, sometimes it was like a spelling error
       or a formatting error, and it'd be, "Okay, I can just easily fix that." I don't
       think there were too many outright negative things. There was one. I don't think it
       was on a prompt, but this artist I really liked at the time commented and said
       something like, "This would've been better with this movie instead of the one you
       actually used," and didn't necessarily anything positive otherwise. I don't know if
       they actually liked it, or if it was just sort of a, "Well, I would've liked it
       better if you'd done this thing the way I wanted you to." Which, it is what it is,
       and you sort of have to just say, "Okay, well, this is the way I did it, and I'm not
       going to change it." But it was definitely a situation where I was like, "Okay.
       Don't know what to make of that."</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Most of the time, people are very, very happy about
       it, because it was just another thing for them to read.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I'm
       very much a person who believes in, if you can't say it in like two words
       then you probably shouldn't. So, I like to have it, what
       is this thing? And that's it. I like to be able to say, "This is what it's going to
       be," and it doesn't necessarily need to be more complicated than that.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
       get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
       distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
       be
       able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
       somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
       something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
       looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
       and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
       is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
       different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
       know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
       way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
       So, I tried to mix it up on occasion.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And
       okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
       notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
       figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
       she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
       Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
       things stand out immediately.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Things like that, you notice immediately, but also that
       it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
       I
       don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
       trying to get portrayed.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
       only get a certain amount of them in canon.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
       it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
       since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
       until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
       a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
       decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
       this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
       case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
       Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
       bit.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, for that chapter, I want to say, like everything
       else in the collection, it was a prompt, but it was something that I didn't want to
       ham-fist it, because Korra's definitely, she's
       traumatized. We see that more than once,</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> So, in this one in particular, she's trying to have a good experience and maybe power
       through it, but then, in that brief lapse where she forgets that she's tied down
       and then she tries to sit up, it's sort of like a muscle memory thing, where
       she's back there the last time she was chained up and couldn't
       move. But also, at the same time, I wanted Asami to immediately
       be there and to be immediately helpful and not push her. She was just trying to be
       comforting. You hear stories about how people
       try and be helpful and just make situations worse, but at this
       point in their relationship, Korra and Asami knew each other super well, and even
       though this is an unusual situation for them, Asami knows how Korra reacts and knows
       who she is and what she's thinking. She's able to help her come back slowly, rather
       than try and make it a quick thing.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I think I'd notice, not spacing errors, pacing
       errors in that, I could've slowed that down a bit, I could've drawn the reader in
       a
       little bit more, just things like that, where it's just like, "I maybe know how to
       write now," so it hopefully could've made it a little bit more
       engaging.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, again, it was the prompts, but it was
       also, I have personally been a little conflicted on gender for a while, and it's
       like my sexuality, it was something that I sort of just say, "Well, I'll get to
       that when I have the chance." So, it's always just sort of in
       the back of my head</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I
       try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
       to live with a person she loves, doing
       something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
       complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
       obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
       yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
       be happy.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
       that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
       most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
       see what they're going through and you see how their lives are,
       and I try not to speak for situations that I've never lived through, but you can
       draw knowledge from that and say, "Okay, well, without going in depth into feelings
       or things like that, I can add this, this, and this, and make it maybe relatable in
       that regard."</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
       serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
       just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
       things that made me super uncomfortable.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's also, given the
       audience, this is considered a family show. So, I realized over time that maybe I
       don't have to write that.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
       it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
       press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
       slaves is super ... I didn't want to
       contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
       [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
       more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
       been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
       thing.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
       though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
       for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>It was
       partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
       Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City,</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I wanted it to, like everything
       else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
       to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And I also wanted to give the collection itself a
       sendoff I was proud of. So, I spent a little bit more time on that than I did a lot
       of the other stuff, just let it marinate. "You know what? This is a good end, and
       hope you enjoyed," sort of thing.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So now,
       I sort of write when I want to, when I have the motivation. And if I'm feeling it,
       yeah, I'll do a little bit. Like somebody requested a prompt two weeks ago. I was
       like, "You know what? Why not. I'm feeling it. We're going to go for it."</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I learned to just not push it,
       don't write what other people are demanding, necessarily.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>My audience should be myself, at the end of the day. I
       want to write the things that I want to read. Even if I'd much rather prefer just
       reading it and not having to put the time and effort into clacking my way through
       it, if I want to read it, I have to write it sometimes, which is fine. But I should
       enjoy the things that I'm writing.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's okay that maybe only three other people
       also liked it, but I like it.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think I started writing
       fan fiction in earnest because I was homesick. Because I had recently moved, and so
       it was with the intent of writing something that was close to home but also part of
       fandom that I started doing that.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I
       think with Twilight it was just that phase where you finally find a
       story that speaks to you, even if you kind of hate it when you look back at it when
       you're older. But at the time, how
       Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
       small community and so forth and deals with depression or
       whatever it is, it just seemed to be something that I could relate to. And so
       I was both interested in that, and I guess in the power fantasy that she was written
       to
       come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
       characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
       was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
       happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background
       and
       the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
       that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
       Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
       I
       could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
       been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
       how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I kind of wanted to see that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular,
       and this was surprising for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I
       never really remember to think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like
       there was this big gap available to us for exploration.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So I kind of wanted to explore that and see how
       Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for me I like to see how the characters
       are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to
       them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>For
       this particular fic, I think it was just the imagery. I was really trying to grasp
       something that in some ways is so intangible. I was trying so hard to get just that
       feeling of desolation and aching.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But the metaphor itself of the Marching Ants, it was
       this way of articulating the anxiety that comes along with that.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I think it
       just came back to capturing that, the imagery of it, the tone of the chapter, the
       voice of it because, at least to me, it works really hard to put us in Asami's shoes
       and make us experience it exactly as she's experiencing it.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
       And in terms of relationships and love and so forth, it was I guess just coming back
       to what I like to explore in fiction, which is how people are interacting with each
       other, what it means for them. And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
       not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
       audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
       exploration. So I like to see for myself how their worth is existing within these
       relationships, what it means for them and what it can mean for the audience and so
       forth.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess the sensation of ants ... I come from an area
       where you commonly come into contact with animals and so on, so I'm familiar with
       the actual physical reality of ants crawling across your skin, and there's a way
       that it feels. It's like a sort of weird, prickling sensation that is very
       disconcerting, and I guess I wanted to translate that into how the story reflects
       Asami's own experience with whatever she's feeling. And that imagery just seemed to
       click with that, just the experience of having something under your skin and on your
       skin, even if you can't quite articulate what it is.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
       came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
       that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Whereas, for
       Asami, Asami didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have
       anyone. So she went back to someone, I
       guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
       for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
       act of violence ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore
       that. It's just fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow
       still find a way to circle back around to the people who have hurt
       them.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
       think I was both going for an understanding of how Asami herself is effected by this
       really terrible thing we see happen to Korra.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's just to be someone who builds and creates
       with the purpose of fixing or making better, but then not being able to do so for
       someone within your personal life. But the imagery also for that chapter was, I guess,
       built in subtext because I wasn't
       quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
       to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
       community.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> It has less to do with fandom
       itself and more to do with the external world. And even now it's, I guess it's ...
       I
       don't know. I think it
       just seemed like the safer option at the time.  But the more
       time I've spent in that part of fandom, the less I guess I've cared about how it's
       read or whatever it is. But at the time, it just seemed wiser, particularly if I was
       having others who may not ... Because fan works and original work for me are on the
       same level, and so I'm not concerned, I guess, with people reading it for ... people
       reading it and not seeing a difference in quality, but rather how they experience
       the content. And so I think I was still considering who the audience would
       be.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So both as a black person and as a woman, it was
       just important for me to recognize that in text and get around to exploring what
       that might have meant for other characters who weren't within the Circle of the
       Avatar and had powerful connections.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because there is this thing in fanfiction where we
       assume that all people who are accessing it are familiar with the text. And while
       that is often common when we want it to function beyond that world to have relevance
       in other ways, I think for me personally it's important to integrate more parts of
       the world, of the universe.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>For me, it was just reminding myself that, even though I'm
       writing something where there are people who are familiar with the text, it's also
       important to fill in the blanks sometimes.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Of course, being
       younger, you don't really understand romance all
       typically well. It's all very idealized. Then as I got older, I
       started liking to delve more into different types of friendships as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
       to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
       bi-sexual. I used it sort of as a tool in some fanfics to work
       through ideas or feelings that I'd had and didn't know how to properly verbalize
       yet. I was putting them on paper, using another
       character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
       where I felt I was kind of safe to do so. I didn't always
       publish all of them, but the one that you contacted me over, I did,
       obviously.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I wrote it in
       one sitting in a Starbucks near my university.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was around the
       time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary and
       I tried to sort of work things out with Jaime as the main focal character</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
       Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
       because obviously they wouldn't be having as
       much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
       considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
       day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
       from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
       versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
       wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
       identity. But there would definitely be some push
       back, but how would that change based on the setting?
       I made her a little bit more comfortable in
       her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
       shoulder for Jaime
       who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
       well.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>writing it also based off
       of my own experiences, just exploring the LGBT
       community in my area, I was kind of writing it from that
       perspective, but also not having as much information as I would like. </li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That, and also trying to write
       and finish an entire fanfic in one sitting is very difficult when it's in a public
       setting. Luckily, it happened and it was a nice exercise as well, just also to be
       able to sit and write and have it really done in one sitting and then put it out
       there was very satisfying.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I did a very brief
       look over and then I was like, "Screw it,"</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I got a very
       interesting response from someone. I believe, maybe a week or two after. They were
       like, "It's a really well written fanfic, it's great, but why in God's (capital G)
       name, did you make Jaime like this?" And the moment I saw capital G, I was like I
       see. I tried to be as cordial as I could and I explained what I said earlier about
       my inspiration</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, that was the one big kick
       back I got from someone. I was a little bit shocked that I got the capital G person,
       but what can you do?</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>While I do ship them together romantically, I
       wanted to write something that also reflected that you could do like a very intimate
       moment without bring sex into it as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It's
       something that I wanted to, again, wanted to bring into a fanfic to kind of make it
       more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and
       wondering the same thing.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
       them being intimate, but it was all
       very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
       vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
       I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
       own instead.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I guess I wanted to
       get a very powerful moment on paper. I had all these ideas and notes about what was
       also going on in the universe and what not, but this was the one that kind of
       started it. I wanted to make sure that I could get it down and not have it be that
       fanfic that I write in my head and then I just cannot put on paper later on.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I really wanted
       to address the gender issue and the gender questioning and write how the
       experiences hit the hardest for me when I was thinking about
       it. Definitely.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think he definitely
       is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
       means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
       it.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
       way and being very new, if you're very new into
       like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
       a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
       higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
       or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
       You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
       anything.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, so at the
       same time I was writing this fanfic, I was writing another one that kind of delved
       into the timeline of how Jaime grew up.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It went
       into his relationship with his father, he was caught walking in his mother's red
       heels and he got very scolded and punished for it.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>This is a topic
       that I was a little bit hesitant to tackle because at the time, when I was writing,
       I wasn't very well-versed in
       not just having a limb missing as a disability, but also how advanced the
       prosthetics were and if they could hold things. I did a little
       bit of research while I was at Starbucks, trying to sort of complete
       everything.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>If I were to do this fic over again or
       update it or add on to it, I would definitely
       want to go more into his disability as well as his prosthetic and how it worked
       more. Things like that to sort of flush it out more because I
       don't think in the fic I didn't do the best job I could at it. It was sort of
       something I tried to fill out as much as I could in the fic, but I probably could
       have done better.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
       wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
       their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
       that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
       work through those emotions with me.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>The first big one
       is never write an entire fanfic in Starbucks.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was
       definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
       back and explore myself with fan
       fic if I needed to as well.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then that's when I kind of got feedback, because the
       first fanfic, I never got any feedback from anyone. I was just like, "Oh, I'm
       shouting into the dark." So yeah, it kind of changed, and it got me a bit more
       active, and like, people actually want to say something about it. What did you think
       about it? I started getting a bit more communication, a bit more activity.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And someone wrote a really detailed review, just about
       how, I remember they said they could taste the road dust from my writing. And I was
       like, wow. I never thought of it that way. That's really cool. That kind of inspired
       me to write more, that I could get that emotion out of somebody. They felt like they
       were actually there with them.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
       Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
       Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
       no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
       brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
       thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
       wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
       series, the first one.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
       know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
       And
       it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
       What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
       And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
       and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
       the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
       that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
       world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
       would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
       maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
       how I got into that.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because I'm
       a length whore. That's the problem. I get into these fics, and I have these ideas,
       and then they expand out of control, and then I get into a story that's suddenly 30
       chapters long, and then I run out of steam. I'm one of those authors who does kind
       of get bored, and then starts cheating on my fic, which is happening right now in
       Game of Thrones.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
       written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
       okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
       alone.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's not done. It's not a solid 200 pages. I'm a very
       chaotic writer, so I will get a bit of dialog in my head. I will see something, and
       I will kind of write around that, and build around that, and string a bunch of
       scenes. It's 200 pages, but it's 200 pages of broken up paragraphs, bits of dialog,
       bits of scenery. So if I ever fleshed it out, it would be much longer, because I
       have a problem containing myself.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I've had a
       couple requests from the other ones. They're like, "I would love to read this
       story." I'm like, "No, you don't understand. It's a lot to wade
       through."</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
       I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
       outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
       really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
       to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a very hard time
       getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
       motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
       are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
       that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
       top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
       think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
       little bit of character assassination.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted to kind of show a Sansa who was still herself.
       A Sansa who was willing to not listen to him, who
       understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
       manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
       only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
       run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
       ends are." That's kind of where that idea came from.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She was
       supposed to kind of get lost in the trees, and they were supposed to find her. But
       I
       thought that was a little bit ignominious for her. So then I remembered, Oh,
       Nimeria's wolf pack. I was like, they haven't used that in the show at all, so why
       not?</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's actually a lot more of that fic that is written
       that didn't make it in. A whole thing where you get it from Nimeria's point of view
       where you can see her. She's like, okay, just following to see what's going to
       happen. And then when Sansa decides to run, that's when she decides to attack. But
       I
       thought that was a bit superfluous, so I took all of that out.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
       of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
       That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
       delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
       Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
       away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
       one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
       fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
       of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
       if I was a former slave. The one thing I
       would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
       in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
       into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
       anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
       like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
       underused character.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
       thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
       in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
       and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
       unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
       me
       try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
       There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
       improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
       "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
       People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
       right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
       The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
       right.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Ratings may change, warnings may change, series,
       spoilers, all those kind of speak for themselves, just to let you know that okay,
       once again, this isn't static. This is something that changes story by story. Some
       of them may be Gen, some of them, I haven't written one yet, but some of them may
       be
       adult in the future. Some of them may have a lot of violence in them, so just be
       aware. Don't ever come back to this fic and think, "This is what it is." Because
       that's not it.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
       never know. I think my
       characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
       "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
       it may be out of character."</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a lot of Game of Thrones stuff on the cutting
       room floor, before I decided what to actually post. And there is about 20 other
       drabbles for the one series that haven't made it yet, because I'm one of those
       writers.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I adore the Dorne
       storyline in the books, and they completely butchered it in the show. So, that's why
       I
       was like, no Dorne's way smarter than this. So yes, he's going to be the Dorne that
       you
       get in the books.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
       divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
       want to get blasted on that one.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
       agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
       dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
       that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
       Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
       we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
       that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
       her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
       supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
       that.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
       beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
       thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's a poem that I really like. I can't remember the name of it now,
       but it talks about moonlight, and how in moonlight, everything is very stark, and
       it's
       clearer for all that starkness. She's seeing everything for who he is.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Sansa is really presented as one of those girls with her
       head in the clouds. She's definitely not a Margaery Tyrell. She was definitely never
       really prepared for court
       life. She has a view of it that is heavily skewed by stories of
       [inaudible 00:33:28] of these wonderful knights in their shining armor, these
       lovely ladies who are just ethereal in their beauty, everything being wrapped up
       in a bow, happily ever after. Maybe something happens, but someone's always
       rescued. And through the series, that kind of gets torn away
       from her bit by bit. The Prince Charming that she thought was a Prince Charming is
       definitely not. There's no one comes to save her. Her brother's more interested in
       being a king than coming to rescue her from the tower, and the monsters inside it.
       So really, Sansa's really forced to grow up,
       and she's really forced to see all these stories as exactly what they are.
       They're just stories. They're empty stories to make children
       happy. So when she's thinking back on this, she's thinking more of the scarier
       stories that maybe she didn't want to listen to.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>What I was afraid of, I should never have
       been afraid of, what I wanted was the thing I should have been worried about.
       She's really kind of flipped the script in her own mind. And
       she's standing amongst these wolves, and it's like before, she would have been
       terrified. She would have been cowering. And now she realizes, this is where I need
       to be. This is where it's at.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
       Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
       without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
       something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
       times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
       I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
       to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
       think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
       sentiment.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
       seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
       woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
       anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
       back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
       Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
       slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
       she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
       jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
       great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
       I've seen it before.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's a smile of, I
       can't think of the word, but being resigned to my fate. And if this is it, then this
       is it. And like I say, she recognizes in Cersei the same evil that she saw in
       Astapor where she's kind of like, "No, you
       would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
       think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
       better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
       are not. You are exactly like them." And in the end, she kind
       of wants to let her know. It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
       that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me. I see exactly what
       you are.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Like I
       said, as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
       be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
       be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself. Kind of like, I hate to use the
       comparison, but if you ever get out of a really bad relationship, and you're just
       like, "No, never again. I know the signs. I will never let that happen to me again."
       And for her of course it's more extreme,
       from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
       decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
       getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
       found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
       myself.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But there are people who
       they're really willing to engage with you, and they have questions. In a lot of
       other fandoms, some people are just like, "This is a nice story." Game of Thrones
       fans will have questions for you in the comments. They'll be like, "What about this?
       And what about this? Oh, what about this? What do you think about this?" It's fun
       to
       get that dialog. That's something I never had before.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>In one of my other fics, there's the Deviant Lord. We
       will run out of the character requirement, talking to each other back and forth in
       comments about things.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I learned a little bit, I actually had to do a bit of
       research on some of the fic, for things like trauma, and how people respond to
       trauma. Especially in the case of Sansa and Missandei, how do people overcome
       certain difficulties after being in these different positions? That was a little bit
       interesting. I did a little bit of in-depth on that, because once again, I'm that
       nerd.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually
       had one troll who just wrote, "Fuck you, you bastard." And I was like, yes. I was
       just like, "Whoa. Okay. I'm sorry you're having such a bad day. Go have a mimosa.
       Just don't take it out on me."</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But
       there are just people who are just nasty. In all the fandoms I've been in, it
       thankfully hasn't happened to me yet, and I've actually had people defend me in
       comments. They're just like, "Get that shit out of here." I'm like, "Okay, thank you
       for being nice." But it seems the Game of Thrones fandoms can get real violent. They
       get real virulent with their hatred in the comments section. I can't muster that
       kind of hatred. If I don't like something, I just click off of it. I don't get the
       hate.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, mostly
       it was Googling, recovering from trauma. I did a little bit of research on former
       slaves, to see their mindset. That was a little bit what I did use for the mindset
       of Missandei. Because people who've been in that situation, they go through, what
       is
       it called? No, goodness, I can't remember. But it was a very good article, and it
       was talking about how former slaves, they go through this process of not believing
       that they're free, and not believing that they're free, and not believing that
       they're free. And eventually, they get to a
       point where it sticks in their head, that this is freedom. This is what they
       have. No one can control them. And then, they get very, very almost violently
       independent, where no one's going to tell me what to do. You can't tell me what
       to do. No one's going to do that to me. Once again, how some
       people where to a much lesser extent, when you get out of controlling, overbearing
       relationships, and then you're finally free, and you're like, "Fuck that shit. Where
       am I going? I'm staying out all night. And I don't have to tell anybody."
       They get this burst of a sense of self, a
       sense of purpose. And I thought that was very beautiful, that there are people
       who can go through all that type of trauma, and they can get there, and they can
       fully bloom. And I always saw Missandei as kind of that character, this
       character who had gone through all of that to the point where here she is,
       standing tall as a character that knows her own worth, knows her own
       personage.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then with Sansa, just how people recover
       from abusive and traumatic relationships, and things like that. The stages of
       recovery.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
       the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
       so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
       Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
       and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>

<h2>Writer's Agency: Reflection</h2>
<div class="interview-search-analysis">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>When fan authors reflect a particular writing choice, process, or moment in their writing. This may be the fan explaining specific choices they made that are not about their audience or motivation for writing.</p>
<p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 65</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The interview moments coded as “Reflection” generally point to the author reflecting on a particular moment from their story. Reading through their quotes provides a sense of motivation behind writing choices as well as the particular thought process in capturing particular emotions or experiences. or choice they made. Pairing these quotes while reading their fics also creates an entire new experience, heightening our understanding of both the fanfic and the author. Their reflections demonstrate how personal and political writing fanfics can be.</p>
<p>Each author’s quotes provide rich reflections of their choices; I will point to some of the quotes that demonstrate the interwoven nature of politics and personal experiences when writing fanfiction. Aria shares how she was learning about the Stonewall Riots at the time, which heavily impacted the direction of her piece. In the last chapter written of her piece, she shows police surveillance and violence targeting the LGBTQ+ community as the police harass community members hanging out at a bar in a metropolitan TLOK location. Aria pulls directly from history, adding in details such as folks needing to wear a particular number of clothing items that represent their culturally-prescribed gender.</p>
<p>Kittya Cullen explains why she chose the metaphor of ants crawling across Asami’s skin to convey anxiety. She comes “from an area where you commonly come into contact with animals,” which means she is familiar with the sensation of ants crawling across her skin. By merging both her experiences with literal ants crawling on her skin and her experience with anxiety, Kittya creates a compelling, tangible metaphor.</p>
<p>In Dialux’s fanfic, she focuses on Sansa practicing Hinduism to demonstrate the isolation Sansa is experiencing. Sansa, in Dialux’s fanfic, has an arranged marriage where she must move far away from her home and culture; there are no Hindu people in her new home or region, so she is the only person who practices. While Sansa, much like Jodhaa from the film <cite>Jodhaa Akbar</cite>, becomes more comfortable with her new home, she continues to practice Hinduism and stays true to her faith. Sansa’s refusal to assimilate demonstrates her power and agency.</p>
<p>Similarly, Writegirl also demonstrates the power and agency of characters who are in subjugated positions. Writegirl reimagines the scene when Missandei is murdered, imagining how Missandei — a Black woman — would speak back to Cersei — a White queen who is intending to kill Missandei. In Writegirl’s reimagining, Missandei “[is] really seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born woman in Westeros.” Missandei also compares Cersei to enslavers from Missandei’s homeland. Writegirl’s comparison between Cersei — a White woman in power — to an enslaver also hints at a deeper, political perspective of overt and tacit oppression. Enslavers enact overt oppression, enslaving people from particular cultural backgrounds; meanwhile, Cersei uses a freed woman who escaped slavery as a political pawn for her own gain.</p>
<p>Valk shares backstory information from their fanfic, when Jaime’s father catches Jaime trying on his mother’s shoes, that Valk does not include in the fanfic. Valk imagines Jaime’s experience learning gender roles and expectations — an experience many share — as well as how this learning hurt him. Valk’s reveal about Jaime’s backstory reveals how authors use experiences to help shape and understand characters’ psychologies. These experiences, like Kittya and the ants, may be based on their own individual experiences or, like Aria and the Stonewall Riots, contextual experiences that they may relate to. Even the smallest choice made both in the final product of the fanfic as well as the process of brainstorming, imagining, and drafting the fanfic are interwoven with personal experiences, emotion, motivation, and politics.</p>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I wrote a piece called Addict's Alchemy, which was a piece about...in terms of
         servicing some of the same things we're talking about today. It's a piece about about
         trauma... And it [inaudible 00:05:20], that this isn't obviously. It's a piece about
         trauma and it's a piece about, what does it mean... Really they're both pieces about
         what it means to be disabled.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world
         and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting,"
         instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with
         it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's
         also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that
         I really was not before.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First of all I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it,
         as a writer. I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's
         beneficial or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it
         now, but I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy.
         I know I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized,
         and I didn't say that obviously in the tags.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
         about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
         those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and I
         couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing I
         was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of
         the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was
         more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll
         do alternate points of view."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't know if I thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought
         about it as a storytelling tool obviously that helps power [inaudible 00:17:00], not
         necessarily about the story if it makes sense. I wasn't telling you things that had
         happened in the past, to teach you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This
         is what's haunting the characters, this is what the characters can't escape from in
         a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you
         know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
         her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
         Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
         is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
         dress herself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And so Asami plays that role, being a person to whom Korra wants to relate, is thrilled
         to relate, is not scared, or she is a little bit scared to relate, but is she scared
         to relate in the way that she's scared to relate to other people.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
         progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
         man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
         and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
         said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
         understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
         woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
         This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
         institution itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>He's not particularly flawed, because he's willing to play this opportunistic political
         game. Because he's also capable of looking at his child and going, "Maybe I shouldn't
         do that." </li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I also sort of wanted to talk... I sort of was thinking about the limits of the political
         and the [inaudible 00:35:57] of the political. You could do what, when and where,
         the idea that a politician can't really save the world. I don't know if I was all
         the way to, "We have to do it," yet, but I think I'm getting there.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was thinking about New York City around the times of the Stonewall Riots. This is
         where those politics come in. I was playing with, what does it mean... I was playing
         with, what's particularly violent political oppression? What are the limits of political
         oppression in a relatively liberal cosmopolitan society? Because I was getting that
         sense of, there's actually a whole lot of ways that political oppression can happen
         that I'd never even thought about at this point, and I was learning about that. So
         I was writing about this character as someone who's experiencing the limits of that
         political oppression. And this is actually one of the key storylines in my opinion,
         and it's ultimately a story about resistance to a kind of political oppression</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This was written obviously before Donald Trump becomes President, and I could see
         all sorts of things about reaction again. But I was seeing the reaction, I was scared.
         I don't know where I got this, there was something bad was coming. I knew that I had
         that sense of fear, so I was writing about... I guess writing a little bit about,
         how do we fight back when things get worse?</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one fic that I was relatively and very
         proud of. To be honest.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And if you're just starting from scratch, then it's
         difficult to create why two people would hate each other so much. I mean, you need
         to have that religious, and
         cultural, and those barriers in order for that to
         happen.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Where I
         just didn't translate them into Rajput or Hindi words. Because I just use
         whatever I knew, because I speak Kannada at home. And that's
         another language entirely. And I was just running out of time, and I said, "You know
         what? No, I'll just handle it myself. And not translate it, and hope that nobody
         minds.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was literally
         just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
         as
         South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
         Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
         and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
         that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
         ideas from.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And
         especially when she has that fight with Jon and she goes back home. And that was,
         I
         think, the point of catharsis. Because especially when you're looking at a lot of
         Indian mothers, and Indian
         women who get into marriages at a very young age. You have to deal with your
         husband's family, you have to deal with that entire kind of stigma. About you
         have to be the one to adjust and to compromise to a far greater extent than your
         husband. And all of these kind of had come together and had
         been marinating for a very long time. And I feel like Sansa, in this, was very much
         the product of that. Where she was
         just trying to fight it, she was such a perfect child in that culture. And then
         suddenly she has to kind of leave her culture behind. Or, not leave her culture
         behind, but adjust to a new culture. And she feels like she's
         being punished by her old one for no fault of her own. And all of it, kind of, her
         desperate unhappiness, her tensions with her mother were a big part of the fic, I
         think, for me.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I
         didn't feel like I could end it with, "Oh, everybody has kids and they're all
         happy." Because that felt very weird, and kind of disjointed with the rest of the
         fic.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And
         in that Sansa can see ghosts. And throughout the entire fic, it's a long fic and
         everything, but one of the biggest issues for me was, how do I end this?</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But to me, it felt like it began with Jon and
         it had to end with Jon. And it had to end with him finally being triumphant, and
         finally being happy for his triumph at the end of this fanfic.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But then the cultural tensions stem almost entirely
         from the differences within their upbringing, I'm pretty sure. Within their
         families. And I mean, there are
         cultural differences within, I mean, people that I've grown up with in India,
         and people in the U.S. And even though you're living side by side, that doesn't
         necessarily mean that you have the same cultural background.
         And I think that's something that both of them don't understand. And both of them
         kind of try to understand slowly.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And if you're talking about other moments,
         like when Sansa wants to give Jon his name, and he asks her to read it out loud. I
         think that's another moment of compromise. Because as much as she's giving him the
         gift,
         she's also giving him his name. And she's stepping across her own cultural
         boundaries to help him with that, which Jon doesn't completely
         understand.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
         that was something that even when you agree to a marriage, and even when you kind
         of
         accept that. Especially when you go into your husband's house, and if you're living
         with his parents and everything. It's a very difficult concept. And it's a very
         difficult idea. And adjusting to that
         is a huge, almost, culture shock to people.
         To any women, adjusting to that is
         difficult. No matter who it is, no matter where you're going.
         So, then, I mean, especially for Sansa, who needs to leave behind her entire family.
         And doesn't even know when she'll be able to go back. And has to go to a foreign country
         without any
         support, and any of her own traditions. She's the one that's upheld every single
         tradition she has ever done. And especially when you're looking at the Hindu
         culture, it's very difficult to uphold them.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, finally, she
         slowly starts to grow into that. She starts to give moments of peace. You know,
         she's kind of giving Jon gifts, and she's trying to bridge that gap. Because she
         also realizes that it's her life, too. Which, I think, is one of the biggest
         realizations that a lot of women have. Which is, "Yes, I'm miserable. I want you to
         be miserable. But how am I going
         to be miserable for?" You need to let some things go, you need to move on past
         the injustices... I need to move past the injustices that I have
         faced.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>The one quote that you picked out here, "You stand before your father, bedecked in
         gossamer and lace and silk, glass thick and shining in your hair." Because that was
         one that I actually remember. Because I initially put the word jewel, and jewels in
         the place of the word glass. But then I wanted it, for her, to feel that it was
         cheaper than the jewel. Even if she had them, they didn't matter to her. Because it
         was just glass.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>As if, her family... Or, she's feeling as if her family is not willing to give
         her as much as she is owed when she's going into a
         marriage.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But then, I also think that one of the major
         things that I learned was probably that some of the anger, it doesn't have to be a
         very you anger to be a very deep one. For it to seep into your writing. Because a
         lot of the time, especially when I'm writing angry stories and everything, they tend
         to be immediate. Like, "Okay, I'm very angry right now. And I want to have a fit.
         And I want to do it." But this was something that it had kind have been, I think,
         brewing for a very long time. And then suddenly the anger, and the angst, and the
         hurt, and the pain, all kind of came out. But at the same time, it was not just
         that. It was also about passing through that anger, and knowing that there is going
         to be someone at the end of it who's willing to accept you.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I hate that I did it, but I did real-person
         fanfiction for Paramore. Thinking of it now, it's always like, "God, that's not
         good. I shouldn't have done it, but here we are."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I'm
         trying to write something that's original, and that's always a bit more of an
         endeavor than you expect it to be.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's funny, going back to the original ones, the
         older ones at least, and reading those, because you sent me one. I think it was
         chapter 37 you mentioned in your email, and I went back and read it and I was like,
         "Oof, I could do this a lot better now, I hope."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a couple that, I don't
         remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
         [inaudible 00:09:21] on purpose, so that it had to be
         like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I also like that you can sort of see a progression of
         how I wrote them and how my own skills have maybe, hopefully developed. And even
         just, it did end up being four years' worth of time</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
         been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
         And maybe, I think,
         during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
         different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
         strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I'm
         very much a person who believes in, if you can't say it in like two words
         then you probably shouldn't. So, I like to have it, what
         is this thing? And that's it. I like to be able to say, "This is what it's going to
         be," and it doesn't necessarily need to be more complicated than that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> So, in this one in particular, she's trying to have a good experience and maybe power
         through it, but then, in that brief lapse where she forgets that she's tied down
         and then she tries to sit up, it's sort of like a muscle memory thing, where
         she's back there the last time she was chained up and couldn't
         move. But also, at the same time, I wanted Asami to immediately
         be there and to be immediately helpful and not push her. She was just trying to be
         comforting. You hear stories about how people
         try and be helpful and just make situations worse, but at this
         point in their relationship, Korra and Asami knew each other super well, and even
         though this is an unusual situation for them, Asami knows how Korra reacts and knows
         who she is and what she's thinking. She's able to help her come back slowly, rather
         than try and make it a quick thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I think I'd notice, not spacing errors, pacing
         errors in that, I could've slowed that down a bit, I could've drawn the reader in
         a
         little bit more, just things like that, where it's just like, "I maybe know how to
         write now," so it hopefully could've made it a little bit more
         engaging.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I
         try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
         to live with a person she loves, doing
         something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
         complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
         obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
         yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
         be happy.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>For
         this particular fic, I think it was just the imagery. I was really trying to grasp
         something that in some ways is so intangible. I was trying so hard to get just that
         feeling of desolation and aching.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But the metaphor itself of the Marching Ants, it was
         this way of articulating the anxiety that comes along with that.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I think it
         just came back to capturing that, the imagery of it, the tone of the chapter, the
         voice of it because, at least to me, it works really hard to put us in Asami's shoes
         and make us experience it exactly as she's experiencing it.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess the sensation of ants ... I come from an area
         where you commonly come into contact with animals and so on, so I'm familiar with
         the actual physical reality of ants crawling across your skin, and there's a way
         that it feels. It's like a sort of weird, prickling sensation that is very
         disconcerting, and I guess I wanted to translate that into how the story reflects
         Asami's own experience with whatever she's feeling. And that imagery just seemed to
         click with that, just the experience of having something under your skin and on your
         skin, even if you can't quite articulate what it is.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
         think I was both going for an understanding of how Asami herself is effected by this
         really terrible thing we see happen to Korra.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's just to be someone who builds and creates
         with the purpose of fixing or making better, but then not being able to do so for
         someone within your personal life. But the imagery also for that chapter was, I guess,
         built in subtext because I wasn't
         quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
         to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
         community.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Of course, being
         younger, you don't really understand romance all
         typically well. It's all very idealized. Then as I got older, I
         started liking to delve more into different types of friendships as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
         Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
         because obviously they wouldn't be having as
         much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
         considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
         day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
         from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
         versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
         wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
         identity. But there would definitely be some push
         back, but how would that change based on the setting?
         I made her a little bit more comfortable in
         her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
         shoulder for Jaime
         who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
         well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>writing it also based off
         of my own experiences, just exploring the LGBT
         community in my area, I was kind of writing it from that
         perspective, but also not having as much information as I would like. </li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>While I do ship them together romantically, I
         wanted to write something that also reflected that you could do like a very intimate
         moment without bring sex into it as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think he definitely
         is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
         means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
         way and being very new, if you're very new into
         like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
         a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
         higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
         or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
         You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
         anything.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It went
         into his relationship with his father, he was caught walking in his mother's red
         heels and he got very scolded and punished for it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>If I were to do this fic over again or
         update it or add on to it, I would definitely
         want to go more into his disability as well as his prosthetic and how it worked
         more. Things like that to sort of flush it out more because I
         don't think in the fic I didn't do the best job I could at it. It was sort of
         something I tried to fill out as much as I could in the fic, but I probably could
         have done better.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was
         definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
         back and explore myself with fan
         fic if I needed to as well.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because I'm
         a length whore. That's the problem. I get into these fics, and I have these ideas,
         and then they expand out of control, and then I get into a story that's suddenly 30
         chapters long, and then I run out of steam. I'm one of those authors who does kind
         of get bored, and then starts cheating on my fic, which is happening right now in
         Game of Thrones.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
         I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
         outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
         really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
         to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a very hard time
         getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
         motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
         are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
         that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
         top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She was
         supposed to kind of get lost in the trees, and they were supposed to find her. But
         I
         thought that was a little bit ignominious for her. So then I remembered, Oh,
         Nimeria's wolf pack. I was like, they haven't used that in the show at all, so why
         not?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's a poem that I really like. I can't remember the name of it now,
         but it talks about moonlight, and how in moonlight, everything is very stark, and
         it's
         clearer for all that starkness. She's seeing everything for who he is.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Sansa is really presented as one of those girls with her
         head in the clouds. She's definitely not a Margaery Tyrell. She was definitely never
         really prepared for court
         life. She has a view of it that is heavily skewed by stories of
         [inaudible 00:33:28] of these wonderful knights in their shining armor, these
         lovely ladies who are just ethereal in their beauty, everything being wrapped up
         in a bow, happily ever after. Maybe something happens, but someone's always
         rescued. And through the series, that kind of gets torn away
         from her bit by bit. The Prince Charming that she thought was a Prince Charming is
         definitely not. There's no one comes to save her. Her brother's more interested in
         being a king than coming to rescue her from the tower, and the monsters inside it.
         So really, Sansa's really forced to grow up,
         and she's really forced to see all these stories as exactly what they are.
         They're just stories. They're empty stories to make children
         happy. So when she's thinking back on this, she's thinking more of the scarier
         stories that maybe she didn't want to listen to.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>What I was afraid of, I should never have
         been afraid of, what I wanted was the thing I should have been worried about.
         She's really kind of flipped the script in her own mind. And
         she's standing amongst these wolves, and it's like before, she would have been
         terrified. She would have been cowering. And now she realizes, this is where I need
         to be. This is where it's at.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
         Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
         without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
         something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
         times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
         I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
         to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
         think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
         sentiment.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
         seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
         woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
         anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
         back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
         Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
         slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
         she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
         jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
         great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
         I've seen it before.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's a smile of, I
         can't think of the word, but being resigned to my fate. And if this is it, then this
         is it. And like I say, she recognizes in Cersei the same evil that she saw in
         Astapor where she's kind of like, "No, you
         would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
         think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
         better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
         are not. You are exactly like them." And in the end, she kind
         of wants to let her know. It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
         that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me. I see exactly what
         you are.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Like I
         said, as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
         be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
         be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself. Kind of like, I hate to use the
         comparison, but if you ever get out of a really bad relationship, and you're just
         like, "No, never again. I know the signs. I will never let that happen to me again."
         And for her of course it's more extreme,
         from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
         decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
         getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
         found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
         myself.</li>

<h2>Writer's Agency: Motivation</h2>
<div class="interview-search-analysis">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors mention their motivation for writing their fanfic or another piece. This may be their own motivation, but also their assumed motivations in the fan community.
</p>
<p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 61</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Common patterns appear across the fan authors’ different motivations for writing their fanfics. First, several fan authors suggest that external circumstances, separate from the original text, influenced their decision to write. For example, Dialux wrote a <cite>Harry Potter</cite> fanfic after her disappointment in the 2020 Democratic primaries. She reimagines Percy Weasley as running on a platform of large systemic change — similar to Bernie Sanders’ platform — and winning, explaining that she needed “some sort of catharsis” as Bernie’s chances of being nominated began to decrease. Aria also discusses how she wrote her fanfic at a time when she was reading about Stonewall, learning about trauma and disability, and being radicalized. Her motivation to write her fanfic was partially a result of her exploring her new political turn and embracing her radicalization.</p>
<p>Another motivation several fan authors point to is their desire to explore particular aspects of their identity and/or think through forms of representation that link to their own identities and positionalities. Valk shares how they were questioning their own gender identity — exploring whether they are non-binary — while they wrote their fanfic about Jaime questioning his gender. For Valk, fanfics are a “safe” method for identity exploration. Kittya is also interested in exploring characters outside of positions of power, specifically citing because she is a Black woman. Finally, Dialux cites her motivation for writing a <cite>Fleabag</cite> fanfic as entangled with reflecting on her own journey growing up and changing her perspective about what she wanted for her life.</p>

Finally, Dialux cites her motivation for writing a Fleabag fanfic as entangled with reflecting on her own journey growing up and changing her perspective about what she wanted for her life.</p>
<p>On the other hand, fan authors also conduct canon resistant uptakes when they are unhappy with a particular choice made in the original text. Writegirl chooses to write about both Sansa and Missandei due to her frustration with the original text writers’ choices. She believes Sansa suffers a “character assassination” and expresses frustration over Missandei’s death, especially how much her death scene moved away from who her character is in earlier seasons and the novels. Valk also expresses frustration with the heteronormativity embedded in both GOT and the fandom. They reimagine Jaime and Brienne’s characters in ways that challenge how fans often depict their relationship.</p>
<p>Finally, Aria provides a moment of reflection not only about her motivation for writing fanfic, but why storytelling can be crucial. She says, “There's a study I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't convince them, but if you tell stories you can.” Writing fanfics for Aria and for many of these fan authors is not only about loving these original texts and fan communities, but building a platform to reach and affectively impact their audiences so they may see the world through different perspectives and reshape their politics.</p>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
         have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
         in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
         I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
         convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
         arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
         very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
         you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
         original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
         through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
         and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
         with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
         get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
         you.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was coming into my own politically, I was becoming my own political individual in
         a way I hadn't been before. Like I had politics, but this is around the time that
         I'm really radicalized, and just me engaging with those contexts.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
         I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
         already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
         weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
         I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
         but it felt more like a nod than a full</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
         there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
         feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
         a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
         different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
         in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
         and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
         looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>but this is what I was doing with my life. I was on my way to running a queer resource
         center at a college, so I was doing the work of feeling the political implications
         of things in the world. And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about
         is to write about... Not just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia,
         not just homophobia, but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because
         this was the thing that was radicalizing me, [inaudible] is vile, because... And it
         was about violence, so I don't just mean violence as a method of resistance, I mean
         violence as a thing that people survive. Because that's what's radicalizing me at
         the time. And so I felt the need to wake up that in a sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political
         institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family
         institutions. My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community
         college is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of
         people that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't
         talk about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
         that was the only source of information.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was trying to write a story that engaged with trauma and felt authentic and didn't
         make trauma seem like the end of the world. Because the binary that's in a lot of
         literature is either like, "Oh, you either overcame trauma, or you are doomed to misery
         forever." And I was trying to find some middle ground, trying to tell a story that
         felt authentic.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to tell a story about connection. And I wanted to make it clear that when
         I'm telling the story, I think that even [inaudible 00:26:39] understands that it's
         not really about romance as much as it is about feeling connected in a genuine way
         to people, that that central theme, building a life worth living after injury, or
         after trauma, is finding an authentic realtionship with people.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>In the context of this piece, a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois
         radical is that I'm not going to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really
         have a sense of class politics at the time, or have the beginnings of that study.
         That's only beginning to be born</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to give a sense of what is the politics of the Northern Water Tribe? And
         I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water Tribe,
         or is not criminalized anymore. Also I wanted to say this is a different relationship.
         But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give
         up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I've also recently published work in Fleabag, which
         was one of the fandoms that I had to write for for my Yuletide assignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>There's a couple of things that you see that are kind of
         interesting, and then you kind of identify a certain actor, or a certain character
         that you kind of find interesting. And then jump from there to another.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yes. I think my most recent published fanfiction is a
         Percy Weasley, second person point of view, post canon. In which he is attempting
         to
         basically restructure his society by running on a platform of big structural change.
         Which might sound vaguely familiar.  But it was, I
         think, mostly due to the kind of deep rage that I was feeling over the entire
         Democratic Primaries over the past couple of months. And almost the past year.
         In which everything felt very much like a lot of talk, and not a lot of doing.
         And at some point, you need some catharsis. And kind of putting it out into
         fiction and seeing something changing. Or, not even seeing something changing.
         But seeing people trying to effect change, and willing to fight for that change
         felt very important to me. And basically that entire fanfic is kind of born out
         of that seething, massive, "I want to see something happening."
         And I will see it happen in fiction, if not in reality.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>was talking about that, and I felt like
         that was a really fascinating look into that psyche. And seeing how Fleabag and the
         Priest would meet up. And how they would be after having separated for 20, 30 years,
         coming back to see each other after they have had full lives apart, but somehow
         still wanting something more. Which, I think, it's definitely, kind of, for me, I
         am
         not old enough to be discussing 50 year old, 60 year old life plans. But my life
         path has never been very straight, or what I felt that it would be. Because when I
         was, what? 15, I probably thought I'd be an engineer. And then after that I thought
         I'd be a doctor. And then, suddenly, now I'm a lawyer. And I thought I'd be in the
         U.S., and I'm in India. And it's a very wildly divergent and strange life path for
         me. And that's only been over, what? 10 years, 10, 15 years. And I can't even
         imagine how that would be over 20, 30 years. And identifying that desire for home,
         and wanting people to be that. As opposed to a given area, or a given job, or
         anything like that, felt very poignant to me at that particular point in
         time.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
         the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
         Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
         film."</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I mean, I think the
         choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
         setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
         trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
         for it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
         view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
         you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
         of
         view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
         what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
         more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one of the
         primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
         sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
         very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
         queer
         characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
         go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
         their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
         situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, it was definitely, when I first started it, it
         was, "Okay, well, I kind of just want to write, and I want to get better at writing,
         practicing it." I started it in college, and the professor I had at that time kept
         saying how, "If you want to get better at writing, you have to write 50,000 words,
         and then, you have to write another 50,000." "Really? All right. I'll just write,
         then. People will give me prompts and I'll just write those as they come in." And
         then, there were a lot of prompts that came in, surprisingly. I was able to stay
         consistent with it for, I want to say, two, three years.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I didn't necessarily want to
         do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to
         a
         point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
         each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
         all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
         can't."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I would start to feel guilty, and sometimes
         would just push one out whether or not I felt it was up to par, even though I hoped
         it was.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
         only get a certain amount of them in canon.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
         it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
         since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
         until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
         a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
         decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
         this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
         case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
         Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
         bit.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, for that chapter, I want to say, like everything
         else in the collection, it was a prompt, but it was something that I didn't want to
         ham-fist it, because Korra's definitely, she's
         traumatized. We see that more than once,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, again, it was the prompts, but it was
         also, I have personally been a little conflicted on gender for a while, and it's
         like my sexuality, it was something that I sort of just say, "Well, I'll get to
         that when I have the chance." So, it's always just sort of in
         the back of my head</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
         serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
         just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
         things that made me super uncomfortable.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
         though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
         for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>It was
         partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
         Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I wanted it to, like everything
         else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
         to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And I also wanted to give the collection itself a
         sendoff I was proud of. So, I spent a little bit more time on that than I did a lot
         of the other stuff, just let it marinate. "You know what? This is a good end, and
         hope you enjoyed," sort of thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So now,
         I sort of write when I want to, when I have the motivation. And if I'm feeling it,
         yeah, I'll do a little bit. Like somebody requested a prompt two weeks ago. I was
         like, "You know what? Why not. I'm feeling it. We're going to go for it."</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think I started writing
         fan fiction in earnest because I was homesick. Because I had recently moved, and so
         it was with the intent of writing something that was close to home but also part of
         fandom that I started doing that.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I
         think with Twilight it was just that phase where you finally find a
         story that speaks to you, even if you kind of hate it when you look back at it when
         you're older. But at the time, how
         Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
         small community and so forth and deals with depression or
         whatever it is, it just seemed to be something that I could relate to. And so
         I was both interested in that, and I guess in the power fantasy that she was written
         to
         come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
         characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
         was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
         happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background
         and
         the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
         that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
         Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
         I
         could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
         been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
         how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I kind of wanted to see that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular,
         and this was surprising for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I
         never really remember to think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like
         there was this big gap available to us for exploration.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So I kind of wanted to explore that and see how
         Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for me I like to see how the characters
         are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to
         them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
         And in terms of relationships and love and so forth, it was I guess just coming back
         to what I like to explore in fiction, which is how people are interacting with each
         other, what it means for them. And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
         not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
         audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
         exploration. So I like to see for myself how their worth is existing within these
         relationships, what it means for them and what it can mean for the audience and so
         forth.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
         came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
         that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Whereas, for
         Asami, Asami didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have
         anyone. So she went back to someone, I
         guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
         for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
         act of violence ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore
         that. It's just fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow
         still find a way to circle back around to the people who have hurt
         them.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So both as a black person and as a woman, it was
         just important for me to recognize that in text and get around to exploring what
         that might have meant for other characters who weren't within the Circle of the
         Avatar and had powerful connections.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
         to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
         bi-sexual. I used it sort of as a tool in some fanfics to work
         through ideas or feelings that I'd had and didn't know how to properly verbalize
         yet. I was putting them on paper, using another
         character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
         where I felt I was kind of safe to do so. I didn't always
         publish all of them, but the one that you contacted me over, I did,
         obviously.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was around the
         time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary and
         I tried to sort of work things out with Jaime as the main focal character</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It's
         something that I wanted to, again, wanted to bring into a fanfic to kind of make it
         more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and
         wondering the same thing.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
         them being intimate, but it was all
         very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
         vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
         I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
         own instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I really wanted
         to address the gender issue and the gender questioning and write how the
         experiences hit the hardest for me when I was thinking about
         it. Definitely.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
         wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
         their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
         that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
         work through those emotions with me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
         Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
         Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
         no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
         brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
         thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
         wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
         series, the first one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
         know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
         And
         it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
         What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
         And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
         and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
         the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
         that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
         world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
         would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
         maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
         how I got into that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
         think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
         little bit of character assassination.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted to kind of show a Sansa who was still herself.
         A Sansa who was willing to not listen to him, who
         understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
         manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
         only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
         run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
         ends are." That's kind of where that idea came from.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
         of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
         That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
         delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
         Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
         away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
         one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
         fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
         of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
         if I was a former slave. The one thing I
         would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
         in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
         into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
         anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
         like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
         underused character.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I adore the Dorne
         storyline in the books, and they completely butchered it in the show. So, that's why
         I
         was like, no Dorne's way smarter than this. So yes, he's going to be the Dorne that
         you
         get in the books.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
         dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
         that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
         Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
         beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
         thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>

<h2>Writer's Agency: Audience</h2>
<div class="interview-search-analysis">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors demonstrate an awareness of their audience and explain how they were thinking about their audience.</p>
<p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 34</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Audience awareness when participating in fanfic genres is important not only so authors can actually reach their audience, but because they are often writing for themselves. When reflecting on who their ideal audiences are, Dialux, Gillywulf, and Valk each believe that their audience is — first and foremost — themselves. Dialux asks herself, “Well, what would I want to read?” Gillywulf says, “my audience should be myself.” Finally, Valk less explicitly says they want to “make [their fanfic] more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and wondering the same thing.” </p>
<p>While imagined audiences for fanfic authors may begin at their own interests, they often publish so that others may also read their work. In order to reach their other ideal audiences, fan authors use specific tagging practices. AO3 provides fanfic authors with a multitude of options for self-reported tags, such as which characters are included, the relationships included, and “Additional Tags,” which are all the authors’ choices. These Additional Tags are particularly important, as authors make clear what fanfic genre they are participating in and include additional information. Writegirl mentions how important Additional Tags are, especially in the GOT fandom, as fans use these tags to discover and read their ideal fanfics. Using proper tagging practices and discourse will allow for authors to reach those readers. Dialux provides an example, too, of crossing over fandoms to reach potential readers who may not be actively looking for her piece. Since her fanfic is a GOT and <cite>Jodhaa Akbar</cite> crossover, she explains how she incorporated specific tags to reach a Hindu audience or an audience invested in Hindu culture and history. Finally, AO3 author-reported metadata can also be a place to provide specific trigger warnings. Aria mentions how she incorporated content warnings to avoid triggering her audience. This practice demonstrates a particular care for potential readers, putting their mental health first.</p>
<p>Several of the fan authors also share potential tensions or fears in thinking about and reaching their audiences. Dialux expresses how she was worried about sharing her racebending fanfic because she wanted to be respectful to bother her own culture and regionally similar cultures. Specifically, she was worried, “Because I was also combining both South Indian and North Indian tropes, to a certain extent.” This fear came because she wanted to respect and celebrate her culture, but also knew about other racebent fanfics that had stereotyped particular races. The audience reaction to these fanfics demonstrates how harmful these racebent fics can be in that they may reinforce, rather than subvert, racist stereotypes or caricatures.</p>
<p>Gillywulf also expresses discomfort in engaging with a particular genre, although she actively avoided participating in particular conventions of fanfic genres. Unlike racebending, other fanfic generic forms, such as slavefics, are almost always harmful. Gillywulf decided to set boundaries with prompts that requested particularly harmful generic forms by either refusing to participate or actively avoiding harmful conventions. For example, one person asked her to write a slavefic, but instead of writing a slavefic that romanticized the master/slave dynamic, Gillywulf removed all romance and focused on the need to actively speak out against racism and slavery.</p>
<p>FFinally, Kittya’s own discomfort was less about harmful generic conventions or potentially triggering her audience. Her discomfort came from the fact that different circles in her personal life read her fanfics and she was not explicitly out yet to particular circles. In her fanfic, she hints at Asami and Korra’s romance in only one sentence as a way to both protect herself, but also signal to the slashfic community. Kittya says if she were to rewrite her piece, she would bring Korra and Asami’s romance to the forefront, but at the time, she had to navigate these two very different audiences — the community she was not yet out to and the slash community with whom she belonged. </p>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then the last one's a content warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see
         homophobia. I can't not publish a story about homophobia.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It was a piece that was sufficiently about me that it would have been fun and helpful
         for a lot of people. But this, I think it was a good piece, it was a piece that was
         a whole other world to read</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I had a very close group of friends on Live Journal back
         in the early 2000s. That, I think, probably because I was a teenager. Perhaps this
         is because of all those reasons. But that kind of close-knittedness has never kind
         of shown up for me ever since. I think I tend to participate now on more, "Oh, this
         is really interesting for me. And this is really fascinating." And I'll go into it
         for the material as opposed to the friendships themselves.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because,
         initially, it was definitely a very close-knit, just writing for friends and with
         friends.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
         person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
         universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I honestly expected nobody to do
         that. It's good to see that people are just as interested in a lot of it, in this
         stuff. You know?</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was really worried about how it
         would be perceived by the fandom, how it would be received by people even outside
         of
         the fandom.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was
         really worried about it, actually. Because I spoke to a couple people before I
         published the fanfic. Because I was kind of worried about it, and I wasn't sure how
         it would be received.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I wasn't sure people would
         think that it was good enough. Because I was also combining both South Indian and
         North Indian tropes, to a
         certain extent. And those weren't necessarily very compatible. And there's a lot
         of history behind that and everything. And I wasn't entirely
         sure how people would perceive it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong> And I was so
         worried. Because all of this was very close to my heart, and I did not want to have
         to deal with a lot of backlash, or feedback, or having to fight to say, "Well, I
         don't mean to be rude on any of these kinds of things." These are meant with respect
         and they're meant with love. And they're from a part of myself.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
         clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
         Jon is raised a Targaryen.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
         because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
         other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
         fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
         particular tag.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Especially the quote that you put up here,
         which refers to Sansa's eyes. Because that was a moment for me, I think, more than
         anything else.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Oh. I think I learned that people are far more
         understanding than I was giving them credit for, especially because I was so afraid
         about the reception.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. Just, I wanted to get better at it, and people
         were really good at giving me things that I could easily do at work,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
         was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
         think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
         prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
         I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
         I can sort of tailor it to that,"</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
         get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
         distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
         be
         able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
         somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
         something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
         looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
         and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
         is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
         different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
         know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
         way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
         So, I tried to mix it up on occasion.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Things like that, you notice immediately, but also that
         it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
         I
         don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
         trying to get portrayed.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's also, given the
         audience, this is considered a family show. So, I realized over time that maybe I
         don't have to write that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
         it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
         press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
         slaves is super ... I didn't want to
         contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
         [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
         more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
         been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
         thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I learned to just not push it,
         don't write what other people are demanding, necessarily.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>My audience should be myself, at the end of the day. I
         want to write the things that I want to read. Even if I'd much rather prefer just
         reading it and not having to put the time and effort into clacking my way through
         it, if I want to read it, I have to write it sometimes, which is fine. But I should
         enjoy the things that I'm writing.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's just to be someone who builds and creates
         with the purpose of fixing or making better, but then not being able to do so for
         someone within your personal life. But the imagery also for that chapter was, I guess,
         built in subtext because I wasn't
         quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
         to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
         community.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> It has less to do with fandom
         itself and more to do with the external world. And even now it's, I guess it's ...
         I
         don't know. I think it
         just seemed like the safer option at the time.  But the more
         time I've spent in that part of fandom, the less I guess I've cared about how it's
         read or whatever it is. But at the time, it just seemed wiser, particularly if I was
         having others who may not ... Because fan works and original work for me are on the
         same level, and so I'm not concerned, I guess, with people reading it for ... people
         reading it and not seeing a difference in quality, but rather how they experience
         the content. And so I think I was still considering who the audience would
         be.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because there is this thing in fanfiction where we
         assume that all people who are accessing it are familiar with the text. And while
         that is often common when we want it to function beyond that world to have relevance
         in other ways, I think for me personally it's important to integrate more parts of
         the world, of the universe.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>For me, it was just reminding myself that, even though I'm
         writing something where there are people who are familiar with the text, it's also
         important to fill in the blanks sometimes.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It's
         something that I wanted to, again, wanted to bring into a fanfic to kind of make it
         more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and
         wondering the same thing.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
         I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
         outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
         really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
         to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
         thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
         in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
         and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
         unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
         me
         try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
         There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
         improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
         The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
         right.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Ratings may change, warnings may change, series,
         spoilers, all those kind of speak for themselves, just to let you know that okay,
         once again, this isn't static. This is something that changes story by story. Some
         of them may be Gen, some of them, I haven't written one yet, but some of them may
         be
         adult in the future. Some of them may have a lot of violence in them, so just be
         aware. Don't ever come back to this fic and think, "This is what it is." Because
         that's not it.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
         never know. I think my
         characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
         "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
         it may be out of character."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
         divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
         want to get blasted on that one.</li>

  <h2>Writer's Agency: Research</h2>
  <div class="interview-search-analysis">
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors discuss forms of research they conducted while they were writing, including fan community research, reading about a theory, learning about language or history, and more.</p>
  <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 14</p>
  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Several fan authors share their research process, either how research they were doing at the time impacted their fanfics or how they researched for their fanfics. Dialux discusses doing research to better depict historical Indian culture and traditions. She is already familiar with some of these traditions, as they are part of her culture; she continues to research, though, as her fanfic focuses on history and she wanted to integrate some historical accuracy.</p>
  <p>Writegirl, Aria, Gillywulf, and Valk all discuss researching experiences that are not their own to more accurately represent these experiences. For example, Valk includes information about Jaime’s prosthetic hand, but since they do not have a prosthetic, they did a bit of research on the experience of using and taking care of one. Gillywulf also includes a story about Korra both a trans woman and a trans man in her vignette fanfics; Gillywulf is a cis woman, though, so she “drew knowledge” from trans communities on the internet.  Writegirl also did some research on the psychology of people who survive slavery and abuse to better understand both Missandei and Sansa’s perspectives. The integration of research allows fans to more accurately depict an experience they may not be personally familiar with as well as represent that experience as respectfully and accurately as possible.</p>

     <h3>Quotes</h3>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because
           I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I would also say a little bit about some of the research I'd read at the time, turns
           out the book I was reading at the time that claimed that knowing someone who was gay
           had a significant...Or not knowing someone who was gay, but engaging with someone
           who's gay on the topic of being gay helped significantly with changing someone's political
           views, or being willing to accept gay people. Turns out that one was actually wrong,
           like literally the person who put together that study cooked the book.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that for
           the actual research it was not so much that I did it for this particular fanfic, as
           it was more that I love that era a lot. So, I had tended to research it before, as
           well. So, I had a lot of information that I kind of knew in colloquial terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I did
           not remember the exact way that he had died, so then I kind of went searching for
           that. And then, I mean, from there it kind of spiraled into researching other things
           and kind of reading up more about Akbar and more about Jodhaa. And I'm an avid
           research. I mean, that's what I do now.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think a lot of the research and a lot of the material
           was just about identifying and pulling disparate ideas together that I knew.
           From either my own culture because, of course,
           this is partially my own culture. And also, the historical
           details of [inaudible 00:27:49].</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think that was what
           was very important to me, especially in this story, was puling it all together so
           that there weren't any open endings. And the research really, somehow, it helped in
           pulling that together.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that the
           thing I wanted to keep in mind was that I was doing the research, but I was also not
           putting as much research into it as I probably should have if I wanted to make it
           historical fiction.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And that was one thing I wanted to be clear about.
           Because, yes, it was research. But I think I wanted to keep to the spirit of the
           movie, as well as the spirit of the A Song of Ice and Fire canon.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
           that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
           most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
           see what they're going through and you see how their lives are,
           and I try not to speak for situations that I've never lived through, but you can
           draw knowledge from that and say, "Okay, well, without going in depth into feelings
           or things like that, I can add this, this, and this, and make it maybe relatable in
           that regard."</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>This is a topic
           that I was a little bit hesitant to tackle because at the time, when I was writing,
           I wasn't very well-versed in
           not just having a limb missing as a disability, but also how advanced the
           prosthetics were and if they could hold things. I did a little
           bit of research while I was at Starbucks, trying to sort of complete
           everything.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I learned a little bit, I actually had to do a bit of
           research on some of the fic, for things like trauma, and how people respond to
           trauma. Especially in the case of Sansa and Missandei, how do people overcome
           certain difficulties after being in these different positions? That was a little bit
           interesting. I did a little bit of in-depth on that, because once again, I'm that
           nerd.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, mostly
           it was Googling, recovering from trauma. I did a little bit of research on former
           slaves, to see their mindset. That was a little bit what I did use for the mindset
           of Missandei. Because people who've been in that situation, they go through, what
           is
           it called? No, goodness, I can't remember. But it was a very good article, and it
           was talking about how former slaves, they go through this process of not believing
           that they're free, and not believing that they're free, and not believing that
           they're free. And eventually, they get to a
           point where it sticks in their head, that this is freedom. This is what they
           have. No one can control them. And then, they get very, very almost violently
           independent, where no one's going to tell me what to do. You can't tell me what
           to do. No one's going to do that to me. Once again, how some
           people where to a much lesser extent, when you get out of controlling, overbearing
           relationships, and then you're finally free, and you're like, "Fuck that shit. Where
           am I going? I'm staying out all night. And I don't have to tell anybody."
           They get this burst of a sense of self, a
           sense of purpose. And I thought that was very beautiful, that there are people
           who can go through all that type of trauma, and they can get there, and they can
           fully bloom. And I always saw Missandei as kind of that character, this
           character who had gone through all of that to the point where here she is,
           standing tall as a character that knows her own worth, knows her own
           personage.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then with Sansa, just how people recover
           from abusive and traumatic relationships, and things like that. The stages of
           recovery.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
           the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
           so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
           Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
           and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>

  <h3>Writer's Agency: Drafting</h3>
  <div class="interview-search-analysis">
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors discuss the act of drafting, or early stages in the writing process such as brainstorming, outlining, etc.</p>
  <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 10</p>
  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Dialux, Valk, and Writegirl each share different drafting processes as they composed their fanfics or other pieces of writing. They each discuss a link between the drafting process and imagining the story before actually writing it down; there is a transfer of their thought process in imagining their fanfics to actually getting that fic written. Dialux shares how she conjures her fanfic plots and characters before putting them down on paper, and combs through these different ideas as she’s writing to make sure they are all implemented. This method demonstrates self-reflection as she drafts, explicitly thinking how what she writes captures what she imagined.</p>
  <p>Valk similarly shares how they imagined this story before writing. They mention they “had all these ideas and notes about what was also going on in the universe and what not” that they then wanted to translate into the actual fic. Specifically, they cite a fear of not being able to “put on paper” the fic they imagined. In order to actually write their fic, they challenged themself by writing the entire fanfic in one sitting at a coffee shop. When I ask what they learned from this fic, they joke, “never write an entire fanfic in Starbucks.”</p>
  <p>Finally, Writegirl also shares how she imagines an entire universe and plot lines with almost 200 pages of this reimagined GOT written. Similar to Valk, she also has notes and ideas written down, sometimes writing extensive scenes. The fanfics she chose to publish, though, are pivotal moments from these 200 pages of her long fanfic. She also expresses a desire to transfer her ideas onto the page, saying “I'm just going to take [the ideas] out and put you here [in the published fanfic], and then leave you alone.”</p>

     <h3>Quotes</h3>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Mostly to keep
           myself writing. Because, otherwise, I would just not publish those materials until
           it becomes, you know. It's basically sitting on my hard drive for years and years
           on
           end, and finally I get the opportunity and the motivation to publish them.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But when I was making the
           actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
           actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
           identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
           identify.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because that's what I keep feeling whenever I look back at
           it, was how I got almost consumed by the characters when I was writing them.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I wrote it in
           one sitting in a Starbucks near my university.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That, and also trying to write
           and finish an entire fanfic in one sitting is very difficult when it's in a public
           setting. Luckily, it happened and it was a nice exercise as well, just also to be
           able to sit and write and have it really done in one sitting and then put it out
           there was very satisfying.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I guess I wanted to
           get a very powerful moment on paper. I had all these ideas and notes about what was
           also going on in the universe and what not, but this was the one that kind of
           started it. I wanted to make sure that I could get it down and not have it be that
           fanfic that I write in my head and then I just cannot put on paper later on.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, so at the
           same time I was writing this fanfic, I was writing another one that kind of delved
           into the timeline of how Jaime grew up.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>The first big one
           is never write an entire fanfic in Starbucks.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
           written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
           okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
           alone.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's not done. It's not a solid 200 pages. I'm a very
           chaotic writer, so I will get a bit of dialog in my head. I will see something, and
           I will kind of write around that, and build around that, and string a bunch of
           scenes. It's 200 pages, but it's 200 pages of broken up paragraphs, bits of dialog,
           bits of scenery. So if I ever fleshed it out, it would be much longer, because I
           have a problem containing myself.</li>

<h2>Writer's Agency: Revising</h2>
<div class="interview-search-analysis">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors discuss the act of revising, or later stages in the writing process.</p>
<p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 5</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Only two fan authors explicitly reflect on the revising process. Aria mentions how she shared her fanfic with a confidant to ensure she was representing trauma in a respectful, accurate manner. In fanfics, this is often referred to as beta-reading (or beta-ing), when a fan creator — either a fanfic author, comic artist, or other fan mediums — asks someone to look over their writing before they post it. Beta-reading can be anything from spelling and grammatical checks to providing larger feedback about the ideas and plotlines. Writegirl also explicitly mentions revising her piece, choosing to rewrite a scene that felt “superfluous.”</p>
</div>

<div class="interview-search-analysis">
   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because
         I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I also learned that you have to be careful with how much to take on, and you have
         to be careful about what you're willing to prune, and you have to be ready to prune
         things. And you have to be ready to follow a story where it goes instead of trying
         to follow all the directions you ever imagined. Because if you try to follow a story
         in every direction you have, then it's going to die like this piece did. It's like,
         "I don't know how to integrate the story into itself anymore."</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I did a very brief
         look over and then I was like, "Screw it,"</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's actually a lot more of that fic that is written
         that didn't make it in. A whole thing where you get it from Nimeria's point of view
         where you can see her. She's like, okay, just following to see what's going to
         happen. And then when Sansa decides to run, that's when she decides to attack. But
         I
         thought that was a bit superfluous, so I took all of that out.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a lot of Game of Thrones stuff on the cutting
         room floor, before I decided what to actually post. And there is about 20 other
         drabbles for the one series that haven't made it yet, because I'm one of those
         writers.</li>

<div class="collapse" id="writerReception" data-parent="#interviewData">
<h2>Writer's Agency: Reception</h2>
<div class="interview-search-analysis">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors directly mention reader feedback and how their writing was received.</p>
<p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 23</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Fan authors each share experiences with positive and negative reception from their readers. Most of the fan authors receive supportive reception on their fanfic, from comments to other fans uptaking their work. Dialux expresses she was originally nervous to publish her fanfic, as racebending fanfics run the risk of reinscribing racist tropes if fan authors are not careful. Yet, she explains that she received nothing but positive feedback, and she hasn’t “gotten a single negative feedback on that fanfic to date.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Writegirl shares positive reception she received on both her fanfic and other fanfics she published. Specifically, she points to one of the first reviews she ever received. Her reader “said they could taste the road dust from my writing.” Finally, Gillywulf also shares mainly positive feedback she received. Because her fanfic vignettes are direct uptakes of prompts her readers requested for her to write, most of her reception was fairly positive. For some of her vignettes, readers requested to see more of particular stories.</p>
<p>As for negative reviews, Writegirl and Valk share specific negative comments they received. On Valk’s fanfic, which revolves around queer sexualities and genders, a reader began with a positive comment and then ended with the question “why in God's (capital G) name, did you make Jaime like this?” Valk points specifically to the “capital G” to demonstrate that the person reading the comment may be religious — Christian — which may explain why they critiqued Valk’s reimagining of Jaime’s gender. For Writegirl, she once had someone comment, “‘Fuck you, bastard’” on one of her fanfics. Writegirl cites this person as a troll and laughs off the comment.</p>

<div class="interview-search-analysis">
   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But that was the biggest bit of feedback I got was this conversation, and it helped
         a little bit.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And that also came across to a lot of readers, is what
         they were telling me, at least. Because they felt like there was a lot more gravitas
         to the entire fic that you wouldn't see in a lot of my other
         fanfics.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But people were very kind about it. And I haven't
         actually gotten a single negative feedback on that fanfic to date.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, with all of that in mind, the actual fandom
         response was absolutely wonderful, and absolutely, completely respectful. And none
         of my fears at all came to fruition.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because they were all so kind, and so respectful of the entire fic in
         general.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
         a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
         always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
         at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
         art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
         it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
         person's mind."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I like that a lot of people, I still get comments
         occasionally that are, "I've just gone through this whole thing," and you can do
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, if there were some things where I'd write the
         original drabble, and then I might get three more immediate requests in my inbox for
         a sequel, or for, "Can I get a full length thing of this?" And I didn't necessarily
         have the time or energy, or just the inclination in some cases.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I mean, most
         of it was positive, which was really good. If somebody really didn't like something,
         they didn't usually tell me. Or if they did, sometimes it was like a spelling error
         or a formatting error, and it'd be, "Okay, I can just easily fix that." I don't
         think there were too many outright negative things. There was one. I don't think it
         was on a prompt, but this artist I really liked at the time commented and said
         something like, "This would've been better with this movie instead of the one you
         actually used," and didn't necessarily anything positive otherwise. I don't know if
         they actually liked it, or if it was just sort of a, "Well, I would've liked it
         better if you'd done this thing the way I wanted you to." Which, it is what it is,
         and you sort of have to just say, "Okay, well, this is the way I did it, and I'm not
         going to change it." But it was definitely a situation where I was like, "Okay.
         Don't know what to make of that."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Most of the time, people are very, very happy about
         it, because it was just another thing for them to read.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And
         okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
         notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
         figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
         she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
         Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
         things stand out immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's okay that maybe only three other people
         also liked it, but I like it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I got a very
         interesting response from someone. I believe, maybe a week or two after. They were
         like, "It's a really well written fanfic, it's great, but why in God's (capital G)
         name, did you make Jaime like this?" And the moment I saw capital G, I was like I
         see. I tried to be as cordial as I could and I explained what I said earlier about
         my inspiration</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, that was the one big kick
         back I got from someone. I was a little bit shocked that I got the capital G person,
         but what can you do?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then that's when I kind of got feedback, because the
         first fanfic, I never got any feedback from anyone. I was just like, "Oh, I'm
         shouting into the dark." So yeah, it kind of changed, and it got me a bit more
         active, and like, people actually want to say something about it. What did you think
         about it? I started getting a bit more communication, a bit more activity.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And someone wrote a really detailed review, just about
         how, I remember they said they could taste the road dust from my writing. And I was
         like, wow. I never thought of it that way. That's really cool. That kind of inspired
         me to write more, that I could get that emotion out of somebody. They felt like they
         were actually there with them.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I've had a
         couple requests from the other ones. They're like, "I would love to read this
         story." I'm like, "No, you don't understand. It's a lot to wade
         through."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
         "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
         People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
         right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
         never know. I think my
         characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
         "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
         it may be out of character."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But there are people who
         they're really willing to engage with you, and they have questions. In a lot of
         other fandoms, some people are just like, "This is a nice story." Game of Thrones
         fans will have questions for you in the comments. They'll be like, "What about this?
         And what about this? Oh, what about this? What do you think about this?" It's fun
         to
         get that dialog. That's something I never had before.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>In one of my other fics, there's the Deviant Lord. We
         will run out of the character requirement, talking to each other back and forth in
         comments about things.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually
         had one troll who just wrote, "Fuck you, you bastard." And I was like, yes. I was
         just like, "Whoa. Okay. I'm sorry you're having such a bad day. Go have a mimosa.
         Just don't take it out on me."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But
         there are just people who are just nasty. In all the fandoms I've been in, it
         thankfully hasn't happened to me yet, and I've actually had people defend me in
         comments. They're just like, "Get that shit out of here." I'm like, "Okay, thank you
         for being nice." But it seems the Game of Thrones fandoms can get real violent. They
         get real virulent with their hatred in the comments section. I can't muster that
         kind of hatred. If I don't like something, I just click off of it. I don't get the
         hate.</li>
