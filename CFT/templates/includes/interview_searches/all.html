      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>People write political theory when they write fanfic, like a lot of fanfic is political
         theory, a lot of fanfiction is political.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
         I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
         convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
         arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
         very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
         you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
         original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
         through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
         and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
         with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
         get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
         you.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
         a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
         different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
         in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
         and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
         looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>but this is what I was doing with my life. I was on my way to running a queer resource
         center at a college, so I was doing the work of feeling the political implications
         of things in the world. And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about
         is to write about... Not just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia,
         not just homophobia, but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because
         this was the thing that was radicalizing me, [inaudible] is vile, because... And it
         was about violence, so I don't just mean violence as a method of resistance, I mean
         violence as a thing that people survive. Because that's what's radicalizing me at
         the time. And so I felt the need to wake up that in a sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I come away from Korra feeling like, "This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy
         that there's not homophobia in a world with gender in the like weird way that... In
         ways that still reflect our I think gender and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the
         way that we have a sense of gender. Big, capital G Gender. And so I thought like,
         "What does it mean to have culture in the context of... What does it mean to be a
         cosmopolitan city where... There's both a degree of marginalization for like the Northern
         Water Tribe closing... Not so much that rules that are really intended to enforce
         gender norms are going to be there. And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a
         different understanding of gender in context," yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was trying to write a story that engaged with trauma and felt authentic and didn't
         make trauma seem like the end of the world. Because the binary that's in a lot of
         literature is either like, "Oh, you either overcame trauma, or you are doomed to misery
         forever." And I was trying to find some middle ground, trying to tell a story that
         felt authentic.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
         progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
         man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
         and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
         said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
         understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
         woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
         This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
         institution itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So to me, Hiroshi's both a man that would destroy his children for the things he believes,
         and in some sense for his own power. But also a man who genuinely is providing aid
         and comfort and resources for fighting for what he views as liberation, and that liberation's
         probably genuine at some level. I think it's fair to say that there is a political
         bender-like supremacy at the beginning. I mean there is, we know there's a bender
         supremacy at the beginning of The Legend of Korra. And so that's how I understand
         Hiroshi.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
         a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
         but it's good.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of [inaudible 00:47:39], some
         of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion that comes out of that. So
         I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and I think that it's liberating
         for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
         love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
         stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
         of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
         of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
         "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
         who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
         of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yes. I think my most recent published fanfiction is a
         Percy Weasley, second person point of view, post canon. In which he is attempting
         to
         basically restructure his society by running on a platform of big structural change.
         Which might sound vaguely familiar.  But it was, I
         think, mostly due to the kind of deep rage that I was feeling over the entire
         Democratic Primaries over the past couple of months. And almost the past year.
         In which everything felt very much like a lot of talk, and not a lot of doing.
         And at some point, you need some catharsis. And kind of putting it out into
         fiction and seeing something changing. Or, not even seeing something changing.
         But seeing people trying to effect change, and willing to fight for that change
         felt very important to me. And basically that entire fanfic is kind of born out
         of that seething, massive, "I want to see something happening."
         And I will see it happen in fiction, if not in reality.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I chose to make it Desi because I am Desi. and I wanted
         to experience it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
         view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
         you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
         of
         view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
         what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
         more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think a lot of the research and a lot of the material
         was just about identifying and pulling disparate ideas together that I knew.
         From either my own culture because, of course,
         this is partially my own culture. And also, the historical
         details of [inaudible 00:27:49].</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
         be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
         because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
         other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
         fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
         particular tag.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
         I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
         make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
         heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
         fandoms. And I think that's probably because we don't have one
         main character and one side character that's like the sidekick to the main
         character, both of them being male. You don't have that here.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
         very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
         queer
         characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
         go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
         their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
         situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
         been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
         And maybe, I think,
         during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
         different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
         strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
         get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
         distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
         be
         able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
         somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
         something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
         looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
         and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
         is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
         seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
         once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
         not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
         the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
         there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
         </li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
         it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
         since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
         until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
         a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
         decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
         this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
         case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
         Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
         bit.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
         it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
         press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
         slaves is super ... I didn't want to
         contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
         [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
         more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
         been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
         thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Obviously, there's always going to be people who say,
         "I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
         care whether or not they necessarily gel." I'm sure there's
         people ... I feel like I went back a million years ago and looked at the first
         Korrasami fics, just out of curiosity, to see when they were published, and I'm sure
         that they were like episode one, because it's just what people do, and it's great.
         Ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, it was there, but
         it's not surprising that a lot of people who aren't looking for it don't go and see
         it. A lot of
         straight people I know will look at a lot of these relationships and say, "Oh,
         that came from nowhere."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>At the end of season three, we saw that development and
         we saw, especially during Korra's fight with Zaheer, Asami looked the most scared
         out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her
         recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, "That's a little gayer than it maybe
         should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
         of people took that and decided to go with it, especially since
         the relationship was [inaudible 01:00:21], whether or not ...
         Again, and at that time, we didn't know the writer's intention, so it was just
         everybody, or at least Korrasami fans, picking
         up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
         so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
         happen."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Korrasami's canon. That's
         what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
         up to that point, there really hadn't been
         a whole lot of huge representation for female ships.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess you can say it was a
         nudge to move from passive consumption to active consumption.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So it was just discovering a collection of books in my
         own home from my aunt and my mother and so on, their teachers. And my aunt in particular,
         she
         teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
         them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
         were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
         know. I guess it comes back to not knowing what you're missing
         until you finally have it. So when I first read texts were people
         were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living
         in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et
         cetera.
         Because even though I speak, let's say,
         like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
         home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
         speak English, but it's a particular kind of English. So just
         seeing that in text and then realizing that the fantasies and so on that I was
         consuming were ... I don't know, it had these strange things that just didn't quite
         compute with where I was living. That's where it really clicked for me. And from
         that point onward, I think that's where I began to see it in everything else. The
         biggest shift didn't really come until I moved to the US, because back home I was
         part of the
         majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing yourself in other
         ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in the news as a
         politician, et cetera. But here it was a completely different
         ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
         was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
         happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background
         and
         the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
         that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
         Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
         I
         could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
         been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
         how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I think it
         just came back to capturing that, the imagery of it, the tone of the chapter, the
         voice of it because, at least to me, it works really hard to put us in Asami's shoes
         and make us experience it exactly as she's experiencing it.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It was sort of ... To me,
         it was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is
         this all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having
         this really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once
         had, and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to
         deal with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so
         forth.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> It has less to do with fandom
         itself and more to do with the external world. And even now it's, I guess it's ...
         I
         don't know. I think it
         just seemed like the safer option at the time.  But the more
         time I've spent in that part of fandom, the less I guess I've cared about how it's
         read or whatever it is. But at the time, it just seemed wiser, particularly if I was
         having others who may not ... Because fan works and original work for me are on the
         same level, and so I'm not concerned, I guess, with people reading it for ... people
         reading it and not seeing a difference in quality, but rather how they experience
         the content. And so I think I was still considering who the audience would
         be.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
         interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
         we
         kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
         thing about fandom
         and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
         either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
         enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
         in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
         world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
         through.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I think I'd actually forgotten about this until
         someone else had written it in their own fanfiction, which is part of what's so fun
         about reading fanfiction. There are all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on
         right away, but someone else mentions it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the
         world and look at it from a different angle.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because there is this thing in fanfiction where we
         assume that all people who are accessing it are familiar with the text. And while
         that is often common when we want it to function beyond that world to have relevance
         in other ways, I think for me personally it's important to integrate more parts of
         the world, of the universe.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think,
         and I'll probably go with my own fandom experiences, it just comes back to how
         the world is constructed externally. So just even the idea of imagining inside
         of what was placed before us, it takes a special kind of familiarity with the
         boarders of the world to imagine a world that is different from what is
         presented to you. At the time, I don't know, it was just that Korra
         and Mako were what was the norm. And so I think it made sense for some people to
         only be able to see that happening. I mean, I didn't see the possibility of
         Korrasami until the very end. But when I circled back around
         after having spent about several months reading several fanfictions</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But yeah, I just, spending so much time reading so much fanfiction
         from LOK and then branching out into Steven Universe and moving
         from Steven Universe into Supergirl, there was
         just more of an interaction with another side of fandom, the slash side of
         fandom. I don't know. I think you have to be integrated with others who are
         looking for more than what's presented, looking for more than what's norm,
         what's the acceptable way of telling a story of any kind of relationship really.
         Because even when
         you talk about what characters are bound to get more attention and more
         interesting and so on and so forth, when you look at fandom in general you'll
         find that when those characters are black or just generally a person of color in
         comparison to a character being white, that people are least particular when the
         fandom's dominated by white faces and so forth. They are more likely to explore
         those characters and to humanize them and to want to get to know them better,
         while other characters and what their hopes and dreams and ideas might be for
         the world are pushed to the side.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't know. I'm not surprised. Plus the allocishets tend to dominate
         fandom in general, so it made sense that they would sort of own the sandbox and
         everyone else should be playing to the side.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I think it may have come back to that as well, a combination of both
         familiarity with visual cues in storytelling, both a tendency to read closer in text
         in general, whether it's literature or visual media, as well as having familiarized
         yourself with another community. I'm always on the fence sometimes when I'm talking
         about how people are seeing or not seeing certain things. Because even with my
         current fandom, it's like half the people are saying that we're delusional or
         creating things where there aren't things. And then other times you see these
         exact phenomena occurring in cishet media.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And
         you could tell, from a fandom perspective, some people who are cishet won't be able
         to speak to
         this, but you could tell that the writer's room was split in
         how they were portraying the characters because I think they got uncomfortable with
         how fandom
         was growing so rapidly and intensely around these two
         characters, even
         to the point where they used the black character as a wedge between
         them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
         in that show. </li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
         to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
         bi-sexual. I used it sort of as a tool in some fanfics to work
         through ideas or feelings that I'd had and didn't know how to properly verbalize
         yet. I was putting them on paper, using another
         character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
         where I felt I was kind of safe to do so. I didn't always
         publish all of them, but the one that you contacted me over, I did,
         obviously.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
         show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
         just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
         not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
         female-female relationships as well, because a lot of the media already does a lot
         of
         the male-female exploration. And a lot of the purpose of fandom
         is to sort of explore beyond what we're just given.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
         Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
         because obviously they wouldn't be having as
         much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
         considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
         day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
         from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
         versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
         wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
         identity. But there would definitely be some push
         back, but how would that change based on the setting?
         I made her a little bit more comfortable in
         her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
         shoulder for Jaime
         who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
         well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to actually put some Game
         of Thrones content on those tags to begin with because back when I was writing it,
         there wasn't a lot really going for it. LGBT fanfics, yeah sure, but
         gender fluid and gender
         related things, it wasn't really there.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think I would want to go
         more into maybe tagging some of the triggers maybe now a days because back then
         there wasn't as much of a discussion around it. Now a days, you have more of a
         discussion around what bigger tags to put in to help people avoid it for instance.
         Now that AO3 has updated its tagging system to include and exclude.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
         them being intimate, but it was all
         very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
         vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
         I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
         own instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
         guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
         to when I came out to them.
         I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
         of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
         having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
         leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
         little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I had some really bad, some
         really heated discussions with a friend on my dashboard on Twitter. We just did that,
         like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
         and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
         interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
         dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
         front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
         interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
         not try and put this away. Yeah, it was a whole mess. People
         came out in droves, angry for different reasons.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And someone wrote a really detailed review, just about
         how, I remember they said they could taste the road dust from my writing. And I was
         like, wow. I never thought of it that way. That's really cool. That kind of inspired
         me to write more, that I could get that emotion out of somebody. They felt like they
         were actually there with them.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
         Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
         Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
         no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
         brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
         thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
         wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
         series, the first one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
         know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
         And
         it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
         What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
         And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
         and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
         the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
         that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
         world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
         would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
         maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
         how I got into that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I literally got up off the couch and walked away when
         she got beheaded. I was very upset. It pissed me
         off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
         slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
         did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
         white women. That was very, very frustrating and irritating to
         me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yes. [Missandei's] a weird character. Mostly she seems to almost
         be absent from things. She's window dressing. She's there, she doesn't speak, or she
         speaks, it's one or two sentences in the entire fic. And it's frustrating because
         once again in the book, she's such a pivotal character.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
         delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
         Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
         away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
         one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
         fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
         of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
         if I was a former slave. The one thing I
         would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
         in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
         into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
         anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
         like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
         underused character.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
         thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
         in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
         and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
         unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
         me
         try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
         There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
         improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
         dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
         that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
         Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And like she says in the fic even
         if I get bit by a lizard-lion or I starve, that's my choice. But it won't be going
         back
         to a ruined Winterfell to marry a legitimized bastard.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Sansa is really presented as one of those girls with her
         head in the clouds. She's definitely not a Margaery Tyrell. She was definitely never
         really prepared for court
         life. She has a view of it that is heavily skewed by stories of
         [inaudible 00:33:28] of these wonderful knights in their shining armor, these
         lovely ladies who are just ethereal in their beauty, everything being wrapped up
         in a bow, happily ever after. Maybe something happens, but someone's always
         rescued. And through the series, that kind of gets torn away
         from her bit by bit. The Prince Charming that she thought was a Prince Charming is
         definitely not. There's no one comes to save her. Her brother's more interested in
         being a king than coming to rescue her from the tower, and the monsters inside it.
         So really, Sansa's really forced to grow up,
         and she's really forced to see all these stories as exactly what they are.
         They're just stories. They're empty stories to make children
         happy. So when she's thinking back on this, she's thinking more of the scarier
         stories that maybe she didn't want to listen to.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
         Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
         without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
         something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
         times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
         I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
         to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
         think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
         sentiment.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
         seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
         woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
         anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
         back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
         Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
         slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
         she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
         jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
         great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
         I've seen it before.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But
         there are just people who are just nasty. In all the fandoms I've been in, it
         thankfully hasn't happened to me yet, and I've actually had people defend me in
         comments. They're just like, "Get that shit out of here." I'm like, "Okay, thank you
         for being nice." But it seems the Game of Thrones fandoms can get real violent. They
         get real virulent with their hatred in the comments section. I can't muster that
         kind of hatred. If I don't like something, I just click off of it. I don't get the
         hate.</li>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't want to be like, "Ah, but I'm writing the version of this character that's
         a woman." I hate that. I know that that's permissible with the meta text but I don't
         want to be part of that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>mostly I felt like I wound up just getting in like an extension of me arguing on the
         internet, which is not a super-healthy way of engaging with communities.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>People write political theory when they write fanfic, like a lot of fanfic is political
         theory, a lot of fanfiction is political.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>People are like, "Oh..." When people talk about RWBY, the way they talk about the
         White Fang is the way they talk about radical politics. And I don't know if they realize
         it, but I always get really annoyed, because this is like bad political theory. It's
         very normal American political theory, but it's also bad. It's very much like, "Oh,
         there's no justification for violence," it's like, "I don't agree."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
         I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
         convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
         arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then I wrote a piece called [inaudible 00:05:42], which was sort of like a revisiting
         of what does... I guess it was actually about immigration, it's just I never really
         ever got around to doing a piece about immigration system, but somebody had a bad
         take about immigration in America in a piece of fanfic and I was like, "God, that's
         a really bad understanding of that friend. That is utopian and wrong."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And that creates fanon, which means you get this whole long space of people being
         like, "Oh yeah, I am writing about this content of fanon in this alternate universe,
         I'm going to write a piece about a radio show</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of [inaudible 00:47:39], some
         of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion that comes out of that. So
         I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and I think that it's liberating
         for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Just real quick, I'm really interested in the fact that Korra and Mako becomes more
         common after Korrasami happened. That, to me, is just fascinating.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also, if you're looking at a subtext, my people they were like, "Oh yeah, I want to
         tell this story, I want to finish this story." And there's a degree to which it a
         queer reading, there's this political tendency to look at fiction and say, "I am going
         to tell the story you didn't." And so during the subtext period, you've already got
         these people who are basically being like, "Yo, I'm going to tell this story.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
         love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
         stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
         of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
         of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
         "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
         who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
         of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I don't know, I don't know if I'd use the fluff and angst tags anymore, just because
         I don't talk about my literature in those terms as much anymore, as I used to, but...
         Largely because nobody...You don't use those tags as much anymore in my view, like
         we don't talk about... Those are very much Fanfiction.net-y terms that pulled over,
         I don't see them as I used to.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that people writing about suffering and happiness, a lot of things happen
         in love stories in general, particularly in WlW and MlM stuff. Well, I don't know
         if MlM, I don't read it very much just because one, I am not a man, and two, so much
         MlM stuff is kind of uncomfortable? A lot it's very clearly written by women.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> a [inaudible 00:57:08] of the audience that come later are less interested in acknowledging
         or talking about race. Given this is a proportion, I don't know if [inaudible 00:57:24]
         but more people as a fandom and those few people aren't interested in talking about
         race in ways that people who had been there before were, and those people who were
         there before continued to talk about race, or if there is an effectively gentrifying
         mmoment that a white fandom comes in, pushes out a fandom of color. I don't know how
         this tag is used, so I would feel hesitant to say something definite. But I find that
         a little bit troublesome.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>because it looks to me here that what you're seeing is a movement from seeing the
         word girlfriend in a context of a text that's about a set of texts about relationships
         in a more heterosexual perspective, in a story about women. Because it looks to me
         that this is a story that, if you see jealous there, that looks like I'm looking at
         a piece that's from Korra's point of view. But then if I'm looking at boyfriend, I'm
         also thinking about Korra and Mako.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>The context is basically just, yeah, things you would expect people would say on a
         date, things you'd expect people to do on a date, things that writers do when they
         run out of words, like chuckle.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also this more mature understanding of a relationship, seeing their partner as a dork
         versus like, seeing them as cute. And obviously you see your partner is cute for a
         long time after you start dating, that... Viewing someone as a dork is a more developed
         sense of what a relationship is.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>That's an interesting set of outcomes, just looking at masculinity as almost sexual
         in the middle there, an almost dangerous. Because a person's understanding of masculinity
         are sexual, like the second one is a kind of dangerous, like a kind of danger. Versus
         like the sexuality in the second one, for feminine as well as that same panel, but
         it's not like dangerous... That's very interesting, it's very interesting that the
         middle section feels just more sexual in general. I was laughing at the bottom set
         for heiress in the middle column, "a-asami" there. It's like, I guess? </li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And to be fair, omega and alpha as being there in the far right column. I don't really
         understand ABO [alpha, beta, omega] as in general, so I can't talk. They're not as
         inherently sexual. They definitely struck me as relatively sexual, and that's not</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I had a very close group of friends on Live Journal back
         in the early 2000s. That, I think, probably because I was a teenager. Perhaps this
         is because of all those reasons. But that kind of close-knittedness has never kind
         of shown up for me ever since. I think I tend to participate now on more, "Oh, this
         is really interesting for me. And this is really fascinating." And I'll go into it
         for the material as opposed to the friendships themselves.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And all of this kind of, to me, I mean, I think that's what
         a lot of fanficiton is, at least. It's taking things that are already there and kind
         of pooling them together. And sometimes you have amazing coincidences that people
         just don't think about. And it's about exploiting those coincidences, and making
         them sound like, "Oh, I'm so brilliant. I actually had thought about it
         beforehand."</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was really worried about how it
         would be perceived by the fandom, how it would be received by people even outside
         of
         the fandom.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
         be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And my friends in the fandom were all like, "Okay, well,
         we trust you. Because it's also your
         culture. You know what you're doing, you know where you're coming from. But we
         would not do it." And, I mean, the vast majority of them were from the U.K. or
         the U.S., and they were not from the same culture. And they
         were like, "We would be very hesitant about it, but we trust you. If you know what
         you're doing, then go ahead and do it." But they were very supportive in that
         manner. But it wasn't a blanket support, as I was kind of hoping for, I should
         say.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I wasn't sure people would
         think that it was good enough. Because I was also combining both South Indian and
         North Indian tropes, to a
         certain extent. And those weren't necessarily very compatible. And there's a lot
         of history behind that and everything. And I wasn't entirely
         sure how people would perceive it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong> And I was so
         worried. Because all of this was very close to my heart, and I did not want to have
         to deal with a lot of backlash, or feedback, or having to fight to say, "Well, I
         don't mean to be rude on any of these kinds of things." These are meant with respect
         and they're meant with love. And they're from a part of myself.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
         because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
         other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
         fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
         particular tag.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Oh. I think I learned that people are far more
         understanding than I was giving them credit for, especially because I was so afraid
         about the reception.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I could
         see how much the fandom had increased in size by the time Season Seven had came
         around. Because it was huge. There were a lot of people there, it had increased
         exponentially. And Season Eight made the fandom even bigger, honestly, in a certain
         way. But I also remember that there were a lot of fandom issues going on at the
         time, between people within the fandom and everything.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But, second of all, the fandom itself,
         I think, had grown to such a point that it kind of imploded. I do remember that a
         lot of good authors, and a lot of people did leave the fandom at the time.
         </li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, first of all, the fandom was
         terrible.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>You can tell
         exactly what the fandom is focused on here.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I was actually
         looking at the most common gender pairings. It's very interesting to me, because I
         think if you look at any other major
         fandom, you would probably get male male slash at a much higher rate than you're
         getting here.
         And it's just very interesting to me to
         see how female male has been so prevalent across all seasons. And to such an
         extent. And, I mean, obviously, there are a lot of theories about why that
         is, and how that comes about, and all of that. But I think...
         Oh, wow. Wait. Hang on. I'm looking... There's Gen that's higher than male slash in
         Season Eight.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
         I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
         make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
         heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
         fandoms. And I think that's probably because we don't have one
         main character and one side character that's like the sidekick to the main
         character, both of them being male. You don't have that here.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I actually do remember how unhappy people were that Sansa didn't
         end with a love interest at the end of Season Eight.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I could understand why people felt unhappy about it. But at the same time, I
         think you're beating on the wrong bush here. There's a lot of other problems to deal
         with within this fandom. And within this canon that we don't particularly need as
         much as you're putting into it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Tyrion is
         surprisingly popular to be honest. I didn't think that he'd be as... I knew he'd be
         popular as a character. But not a person on Archive of Our Own. I didn't think that
         AO3 people would write a lot about him.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
         been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
         And maybe, I think,
         during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
         different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
         strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And sometimes, there were just
         prompts that were not necessarily things that I wanted to do or actively didn't want
         to do</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> I
         know it's, I don't want to say a popular trope, but it's a common trope in a lot of
         fanfiction communities, is the student-teacher
         ... What is that? Student-teacher pairing, whatever. My dad is a teacher, so the
         idea of that has always just absolutely not been something that I want to
         encourage, and it just isn't good, so I don't like writing that, I don't like
         reading it. That's definitely one of the things. I'm sure
         there's been others, but that's always been a big one for me.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
         get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
         distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
         be
         able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
         somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
         something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
         looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
         and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
         is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
         seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
         once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
         not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
         the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
         there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
         </li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
         it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
         since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
         until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
         a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
         decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
         this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
         case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
         Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
         bit.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
         that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
         most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
         see what they're going through and you see how their lives are,
         and I try not to speak for situations that I've never lived through, but you can
         draw knowledge from that and say, "Okay, well, without going in depth into feelings
         or things like that, I can add this, this, and this, and make it maybe relatable in
         that regard."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's also, given the
         audience, this is considered a family show. So, I realized over time that maybe I
         don't have to write that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
         it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
         press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
         slaves is super ... I didn't want to
         contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
         [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
         more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
         been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
         thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Especially with the prompts and setting boundaries like you
         mentioned earlier. It's writing what you want.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Oh,
         the easy answer is sexism,
         because everyone sees the main heroine next to a cute boy and decides, "That's
         good. I'm going to do that," without maybe necessarily putting much more thought
         into it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Obviously, there's always going to be people who say,
         "I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
         care whether or not they necessarily gel." I'm sure there's
         people ... I feel like I went back a million years ago and looked at the first
         Korrasami fics, just out of curiosity, to see when they were published, and I'm sure
         that they were like episode one, because it's just what people do, and it's great.
         Ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, it was there, but
         it's not surprising that a lot of people who aren't looking for it don't go and see
         it. A lot of
         straight people I know will look at a lot of these relationships and say, "Oh,
         that came from nowhere."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>At the end of season three, we saw that development and
         we saw, especially during Korra's fight with Zaheer, Asami looked the most scared
         out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her
         recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, "That's a little gayer than it maybe
         should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
         of people took that and decided to go with it, especially since
         the relationship was [inaudible 01:00:21], whether or not ...
         Again, and at that time, we didn't know the writer's intention, so it was just
         everybody, or at least Korrasami fans, picking
         up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
         so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
         happen."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Tahno was just a bully that people decide ... I don't
         understand why people like that, but people do.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> immediately after
         the season finale aired, everyone was sort of unsure like, "This is canon, right?
         This is canon. That's what this looks
         like,"</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Korrasami's canon. That's
         what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
         up to that point, there really hadn't been
         a whole lot of huge representation for female ships.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
         see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
         god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
         have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I got into forums and fans would
         translate for those of us who didn't speak Hindi. And obviously
         people would answer questions if you asked because you couldn't get everything in
         the translations or the summaries. And during that time, we would talk about the
         plot of the show, what the characters were doing, where we were expecting things to
         go at that time. It was just a lot of the basic things at fandom.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>To
         realizing that there was a community of people who were also interested in
         discussing how these shows and books and games et cetera were failing us, whether
         it
         was in terms of the content or the representation or just releasing new things like
         thought arcs that weren't followed through on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But also the fics I had read after the
         show had finished seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ...
         Obviously, it was a really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had
         happened in the gap years that they hadn't shown us for Korra.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's just to be someone who builds and creates
         with the purpose of fixing or making better, but then not being able to do so for
         someone within your personal life. But the imagery also for that chapter was, I guess,
         built in subtext because I wasn't
         quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
         to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
         community.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> It has less to do with fandom
         itself and more to do with the external world. And even now it's, I guess it's ...
         I
         don't know. I think it
         just seemed like the safer option at the time.  But the more
         time I've spent in that part of fandom, the less I guess I've cared about how it's
         read or whatever it is. But at the time, it just seemed wiser, particularly if I was
         having others who may not ... Because fan works and original work for me are on the
         same level, and so I'm not concerned, I guess, with people reading it for ... people
         reading it and not seeing a difference in quality, but rather how they experience
         the content. And so I think I was still considering who the audience would
         be.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
         interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
         we
         kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
         thing about fandom
         and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
         either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
         enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
         in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
         world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
         through.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I wasn't part of the fandom itself, so I didn't quite
         get to be part of ... Maybe I should be happy for that because I missed all the fan
         wars.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
         missed the smug satisfaction, but I also missed all the stress and anger, so I'm
         happy for that.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Considering my Supergirl years, I can imagine. And then when you
         [inaudible 00:45:32]
         Korra is an avatar who's a
         woman.
         She's not a dainty fainting
         flower that they love.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because there is this thing in fanfiction where we
         assume that all people who are accessing it are familiar with the text. And while
         that is often common when we want it to function beyond that world to have relevance
         in other ways, I think for me personally it's important to integrate more parts of
         the world, of the universe.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think,
         and I'll probably go with my own fandom experiences, it just comes back to how
         the world is constructed externally. So just even the idea of imagining inside
         of what was placed before us, it takes a special kind of familiarity with the
         boarders of the world to imagine a world that is different from what is
         presented to you. At the time, I don't know, it was just that Korra
         and Mako were what was the norm. And so I think it made sense for some people to
         only be able to see that happening. I mean, I didn't see the possibility of
         Korrasami until the very end. But when I circled back around
         after having spent about several months reading several fanfictions</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But yeah, I just, spending so much time reading so much fanfiction
         from LOK and then branching out into Steven Universe and moving
         from Steven Universe into Supergirl, there was
         just more of an interaction with another side of fandom, the slash side of
         fandom. I don't know. I think you have to be integrated with others who are
         looking for more than what's presented, looking for more than what's norm,
         what's the acceptable way of telling a story of any kind of relationship really.
         Because even when
         you talk about what characters are bound to get more attention and more
         interesting and so on and so forth, when you look at fandom in general you'll
         find that when those characters are black or just generally a person of color in
         comparison to a character being white, that people are least particular when the
         fandom's dominated by white faces and so forth. They are more likely to explore
         those characters and to humanize them and to want to get to know them better,
         while other characters and what their hopes and dreams and ideas might be for
         the world are pushed to the side.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't know. I'm not surprised. Plus the allocishets tend to dominate
         fandom in general, so it made sense that they would sort of own the sandbox and
         everyone else should be playing to the side.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
         mean, people are out there writing Korra Tarrlok fanfic. Okay, but Korrasami just
         seems too weird,
         okay people. I mean, I was also part of it too, that people were so willing to see
         all these other,
         in some ways really twisted, relationship dynamics, but
         couldn't quite bring
         themselves to see what others were seeing when they took the allocishet glasses
         off. I was part of that group as well, until in the end.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>When I saw that I was like, "Okay. This is pretty blatant. I
         don't see how anyone is not seeing this." But I can't judge
         because when you go back and you see the way that Korra and Asami speak to each
         other in the beginning, it's there, but it's not intentional subtext. It's like ...
         I mean, it makes sense that some people didn't see it.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I think it may have come back to that as well, a combination of both
         familiarity with visual cues in storytelling, both a tendency to read closer in text
         in general, whether it's literature or visual media, as well as having familiarized
         yourself with another community. I'm always on the fence sometimes when I'm talking
         about how people are seeing or not seeing certain things. Because even with my
         current fandom, it's like half the people are saying that we're delusional or
         creating things where there aren't things. And then other times you see these
         exact phenomena occurring in cishet media.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At
         that time ... When I first came across it, I was like, "They're probably
         overreacting," because I know how fandom can get.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And
         you could tell, from a fandom perspective, some people who are cishet won't be able
         to speak to
         this, but you could tell that the writer's room was split in
         how they were portraying the characters because I think they got uncomfortable with
         how fandom
         was growing so rapidly and intensely around these two
         characters, even
         to the point where they used the black character as a wedge between
         them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
         in that show. </li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
         to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
         bi-sexual. I used it sort of as a tool in some fanfics to work
         through ideas or feelings that I'd had and didn't know how to properly verbalize
         yet. I was putting them on paper, using another
         character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
         where I felt I was kind of safe to do so. I didn't always
         publish all of them, but the one that you contacted me over, I did,
         obviously.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
         show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
         just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
         not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
         female-female relationships as well, because a lot of the media already does a lot
         of
         the male-female exploration. And a lot of the purpose of fandom
         is to sort of explore beyond what we're just given.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, definitely when it comes to trying to write it
         realistically as well, but the banter back and forth was very difficult. I read a
         lot of fanfic where it can be very stalkish and when I think about it and I think
         about someone saying it out loud, I just like cringe. My face caves in.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to actually put some Game
         of Thrones content on those tags to begin with because back when I was writing it,
         there wasn't a lot really going for it. LGBT fanfics, yeah sure, but
         gender fluid and gender
         related things, it wasn't really there.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I feel for them, a lot of their fics also had a lot of like Jaime
         being the man and Brienne finally being able to let her guard
         down.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Like, where is this content that
         should be out there because it's in the books and why is no one taking this up and
         writing about it?</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think I would want to go
         more into maybe tagging some of the triggers maybe now a days because back then
         there wasn't as much of a discussion around it. Now a days, you have more of a
         discussion around what bigger tags to put in to help people avoid it for instance.
         Now that AO3 has updated its tagging system to include and exclude.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
         them being intimate, but it was all
         very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
         vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
         I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
         own instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>And then it just kind of gets more
         depressing as it goes on. For some reason, John and Sansa's the most popular ship.
         It's like, I understand that they're not technically related, but I don't get it
         because in the book, they had this very tense relationship and in the show I know
         that they were more around each other.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Peytr/Sansa, I want to have some words with people.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
         them, but I
         don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
         just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
         literally right here.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>
         Renly/Lauris,
         obviously.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Sandor and Sansa, I will say that I like their ship name
         as San-San. I do understand the whole
         like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
         romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
         just write a Nora Roberts novel." I'd so read her books if I
         wanted to. I don't need to read them here.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Most Game of Thrones fanfic is incredibly hetero
         normative and it's a lot of university AU, high school AU and
         I'm like, "What about literally anything else?" I did a modern universe
         [inaudible 00:37:49] Please, literally anything
         else.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Again, it's Renly/Lauris,
         Sansa/Marjory. Yeah, there's not a lot really on there.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was just a lot of Nora Roberts style in AO3 for
         sure. A lot of incest. An exorbitant amount of
         incest, like beyond what I even take it. I'm typically very do what you want,
         but even now, I'm just like don't like that.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, it's depressingly small. I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
         less fanfic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
         unique friendship/relationship</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>a lot of
         the fics, even with Jaime and Brienne is just depressingly, like, "Wow, if I
         wanted to read this fic, I'd just go to like any romance section and find
         it."</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I would almost want to just write fic out of
         spite.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I had some really bad, some
         really heated discussions with a friend on my dashboard on Twitter. We just did that,
         like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
         and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
         interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
         dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
         front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
         interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
         not try and put this away. Yeah, it was a whole mess. People
         came out in droves, angry for different reasons.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because one thing as a writer that will pull me completely out of a story is if
         there is a colloquialism that should not belong. Or if
         you're using words, and I'm like, okay, I've never heard that word used on the show,
         so now you've just dropped a bomb in the middle of a wedding cake, and there's cake
         everywhere. It just pulls me out.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yes. [Missandei's] a weird character. Mostly she seems to almost
         be absent from things. She's window dressing. She's there, she doesn't speak, or she
         speaks, it's one or two sentences in the entire fic. And it's frustrating because
         once again in the book, she's such a pivotal character.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And so, you get those fics where she
         either has none of those, she's either not there, or she has really none of those
         attributes. She's kind of just a yes person. Yes, Khaleesi, no Khaleesi, yes my
         queen.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
         delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
         Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
         away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
         one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
         fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
         of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
         if I was a former slave. The one thing I
         would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
         in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
         into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
         anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
         like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
         underused character.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
         thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
         in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
         and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
         unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
         me
         try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
         There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
         improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
         "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
         People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
         right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
         never know. I think my
         characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
         "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
         it may be out of character."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
         divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
         want to get blasted on that one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I've learned a lot about people actually in the fandom.
         Game of Thrones has a very active fandom. I wasn't prepared for that when I joined.
         You get people who, there are the butts, there are the trolls. Trolls are going to
         troll though, so I just kind of push them to the side.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But there are people who
         they're really willing to engage with you, and they have questions. In a lot of
         other fandoms, some people are just like, "This is a nice story." Game of Thrones
         fans will have questions for you in the comments. They'll be like, "What about this?
         And what about this? Oh, what about this? What do you think about this?" It's fun
         to
         get that dialog. That's something I never had before.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But
         there are just people who are just nasty. In all the fandoms I've been in, it
         thankfully hasn't happened to me yet, and I've actually had people defend me in
         comments. They're just like, "Get that shit out of here." I'm like, "Okay, thank you
         for being nice." But it seems the Game of Thrones fandoms can get real violent. They
         get real virulent with their hatred in the comments section. I can't muster that
         kind of hatred. If I don't like something, I just click off of it. I don't get the
         hate.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But I can
         see, especially in Season Five, and Six, and Seven, where you see Jon Snow, Sansa
         Stark, because these two characters kind of get back together in the show. When
         they're together, you can see their dynamic in everything else. And they look good
         together. That's always a good thing. It's always big when it comes to shipping, who
         looks good with who.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But I think people really enjoy the Jaime Lannister, Brienne of
         Tarth is kind of like the person, your frenemy. The person you love to hate.
         I would rescue you if you're falling off a cliff, but I'd probably punch you in the
         stomach when I got you back on solid land for being in that position to begin
         with.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Sansa, Petyr, I've always hated that one, simply because he's grooming. It's
         very obvious. Where I can see Sansa starting to like Sandor
         because he would rebuff her at every turn if she started to show interest in him,
         even though he didn't want to. He'd just be like, "I can't deal with this. I can't
         deal with you." Petyr would relish that. He
         does everything he can to get her into trusting him, and thinking of him as her
         friend, and I would do anything for you, and that's really, really creepy. It's
         always a surprise to me when I see Petyr Baelish, Sansa Stark fics especially
         ones where it's not manipulative, and coercive, and creepy, I'm like, "What are
         you guys seeing in that?" That's just odd.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I like the modern setting. Modern setting seems to be the most
         common one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
         active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
         especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
         and
         putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>canon divergence, angst, love, romance, smut. Not really. Everything seems to be kind
         of
         right where it should be, based on what I've seen. I'm trying to think of a tag that
         may
         be missing. No. Fluff, yeah, fluff's there, angst, romance. No, I think everything
         is
         there. You just randomly go on AO3, that's what you'd see.</li>

   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>People are like, "Oh..." When people talk about RWBY, the way they talk about the
         White Fang is the way they talk about radical politics. And I don't know if they realize
         it, but I always get really annoyed, because this is like bad political theory. It's
         very normal American political theory, but it's also bad. It's very much like, "Oh,
         there's no justification for violence," it's like, "I don't agree."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
         I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
         convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
         arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then I wrote a piece called [inaudible 00:05:42], which was sort of like a revisiting
         of what does... I guess it was actually about immigration, it's just I never really
         ever got around to doing a piece about immigration system, but somebody had a bad
         take about immigration in America in a piece of fanfic and I was like, "God, that's
         a really bad understanding of that friend. That is utopian and wrong."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
         very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
         you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
         original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
         through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
         and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
         with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
         get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
         you.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was coming into my own politically, I was becoming my own political individual in
         a way I hadn't been before. Like I had politics, but this is around the time that
         I'm really radicalized, and just me engaging with those contexts.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
         there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
         feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
         a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
         different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
         in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
         and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
         looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I was under the impression, reading or engaging with this text, I came away with
         this feeling like the Northern Water Tribe is somewhat... very different from the
         rest of the world, and there are ways that it plays as... I don't know if it was textual
         or sort of fan-driven more, but I remember coming away with this feeling that there
         is a marginalized subjectivity in the Northern Water Tribe. And so telling this story
         about difference in culture, and we'll get to... I'll get to Korra's upbringing a
         little bit later, because you're going to ask about 10 minutes later about Korra's
         upbringing. But I want to... Basically that I think Korra's upbringing is particularly
         reflective of that culture, yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I come away from Korra feeling like, "This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy
         that there's not homophobia in a world with gender in the like weird way that... In
         ways that still reflect our I think gender and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the
         way that we have a sense of gender. Big, capital G Gender. And so I thought like,
         "What does it mean to have culture in the context of... What does it mean to be a
         cosmopolitan city where... There's both a degree of marginalization for like the Northern
         Water Tribe closing... Not so much that rules that are really intended to enforce
         gender norms are going to be there. And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a
         different understanding of gender in context," yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Asami probably can't like cook...because I think it's either canonical or in fanon,
         and I kind of like that, because I like the notion that... I like the notion that
         someone who's very good at some things, but just not good at other things.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that this is a piece that comes from a weird part of what I understood about
         that world. To me, Korra grows up in a compound with people who are older than her,
         who aren't likely to tell her the truth about things. Because the White Lotus is an
         organization of people who are fundamentally keeping her apart. And I remember being
         like, "Oh, these folks are not going to tell a child about queer sexuality." Particularly
         sexuality is a hard topic, you grow up in that kind of compound in a world where queer
         identities are looked down on, you're going to come away with this very strange view
         about that. And you might just be told nothing.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
         her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
         Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
         is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
         dress herself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
         progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
         man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
         and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
         said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
         understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
         woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
         This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
         institution itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>In the context of this piece, a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois
         radical is that I'm not going to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really
         have a sense of class politics at the time, or have the beginnings of that study.
         That's only beginning to be born</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So to me, Hiroshi's both a man that would destroy his children for the things he believes,
         and in some sense for his own power. But also a man who genuinely is providing aid
         and comfort and resources for fighting for what he views as liberation, and that liberation's
         probably genuine at some level. I think it's fair to say that there is a political
         bender-like supremacy at the beginning. I mean there is, we know there's a bender
         supremacy at the beginning of The Legend of Korra. And so that's how I understand
         Hiroshi.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to give a sense of what is the politics of the Northern Water Tribe? And
         I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water Tribe,
         or is not criminalized anymore. Also I wanted to say this is a different relationship.
         But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give
         up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I know what our reactionary politics is like, I think I'd start around the
         time that Kuvira is beginning to gain power. I'd write it as a story that talks about
         immigration, and talks about sweeping panic and fear that spill off of that. I'd probably
         talk about gender through those lenses, and I'd probably talk about humanity in a
         slightly more complex... I'd probably make it a story that... I'd probably both use
         modern messages to say that, I'd probably talk more about police state, and police
         state as endless spying networks where you don't know when you're being spied on and
         when you're not, and endless police states</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
         a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
         but it's good.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also I think it's when fiction ends, it does draw people who are like, "Oh, I want
         to write more on this subject, I want to play with these concepts again." There's
         also a distinct un-ended-ness</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad.
         But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want
         to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want
         to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that!
         I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.[inaudible 00:47:08]
         what are other ways we can imagine it?</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And that creates fanon, which means you get this whole long space of people being
         like, "Oh yeah, I am writing about this content of fanon in this alternate universe,
         I'm going to write a piece about a radio show</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of [inaudible 00:47:39], some
         of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion that comes out of that. So
         I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and I think that it's liberating
         for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also, if you're looking at a subtext, my people they were like, "Oh yeah, I want to
         tell this story, I want to finish this story." And there's a degree to which it a
         queer reading, there's this political tendency to look at fiction and say, "I am going
         to tell the story you didn't." And so during the subtext period, you've already got
         these people who are basically being like, "Yo, I'm going to tell this story.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
         love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
         stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
         of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
         of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
         "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
         who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
         of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I don't know, I don't know if I'd use the fluff and angst tags anymore, just because
         I don't talk about my literature in those terms as much anymore, as I used to, but...
         Largely because nobody...You don't use those tags as much anymore in my view, like
         we don't talk about... Those are very much Fanfiction.net-y terms that pulled over,
         I don't see them as I used to.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon
         compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant,"
         as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant
         sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense
         to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a
         story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine
         that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on
         what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now.
         That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories
         that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I imagine that it's because... It makes sense to tell a friendship story with characters
         who are already very close friends, and characters who are becoming close friends.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I mean, canon queer relationship is more common because there is canon queer relationship.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> a [inaudible 00:57:08] of the audience that come later are less interested in acknowledging
         or talking about race. Given this is a proportion, I don't know if [inaudible 00:57:24]
         but more people as a fandom and those few people aren't interested in talking about
         race in ways that people who had been there before were, and those people who were
         there before continued to talk about race, or if there is an effectively gentrifying
         mmoment that a white fandom comes in, pushes out a fandom of color. I don't know how
         this tag is used, so I would feel hesitant to say something definite. But I find that
         a little bit troublesome.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>because it looks to me here that what you're seeing is a movement from seeing the
         word girlfriend in a context of a text that's about a set of texts about relationships
         in a more heterosexual perspective, in a story about women. Because it looks to me
         that this is a story that, if you see jealous there, that looks like I'm looking at
         a piece that's from Korra's point of view. But then if I'm looking at boyfriend, I'm
         also thinking about Korra and Mako.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>The context is basically just, yeah, things you would expect people would say on a
         date, things you'd expect people to do on a date, things that writers do when they
         run out of words, like chuckle.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also this more mature understanding of a relationship, seeing their partner as a dork
         versus like, seeing them as cute. And obviously you see your partner is cute for a
         long time after you start dating, that... Viewing someone as a dork is a more developed
         sense of what a relationship is.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I've also recently published work in Fleabag, which
         was one of the fandoms that I had to write for for my Yuletide assignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
         the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
         Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
         film."</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
         person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
         universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
         view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
         you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
         of
         view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
         what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
         more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, of course, you have the Targaryen
         colors, which are black, which are mourning colors according to the Western
         culture. And all of it kind of comes together. And, of course,
         Rajput culture is known for its red, its vibrant, blood red. And obviously, that's
         a
         Targaryen color.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
         clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
         Jon is raised a Targaryen.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
         because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
         other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
         fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
         particular tag.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But within this particular fic, as I said earlier, I
         really wanted to already have that tension. Especially that religious tension between
         Jon and
         Sansa. And have that difference, where both of them and neither of them are
         willing to compromise on that.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the regional tensions, I think, are already
         there in the canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, I mean, we don't know if she relies more on
         her religion because she left her homeland, and came to the North. And just
         wanted some desperate way, something to rely on that's her family, or that
         reminded her of home. But to me, at least, I can imagine, especially the actual
         Jodhaa, going to Akbar's Islamic court. And basically being all alone, and not
         having very many allies. And finding some sort of a solace in her religion of
         Hinduism.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>A Jon who would grow up in a Targaryen
         court would look very different in the Targaryen [inaudible
         00:53:09] than with a Targaryen father.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the thing is, as much as he looked like Ned on a physical level, Ned is not the
         Ned that we see in canon. Because he's very much a person who has been basically
         warring for however Jon has been alive.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, actually, Aishwarya Rai, who plays Jodhaa,
         does not have brown eyes. She has hazel eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
         I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
         make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
         heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
         fandoms. And I think that's probably because we don't have one
         main character and one side character that's like the sidekick to the main
         character, both of them being male. You don't have that here.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because
         I know that a lot of people had mentioned that it was at the beginning of Season
         Six. Like, when a couple of trailers came out regarding Sansa meeting up with
         somebody in the North. It was kind of staging with Ramsay Bolton. That Jon Snow and
         Sansa Stark fandom kind of really took off. And it was the beginning of Season Six
         that it really, properly emerged. So, it would be interesting to see if there is a
         cookie cutter point that you can identify like, this is where the general public
         kind of suddenly said, "Oh, this is the moment."</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But Sansa, she
         didn't have any such love interests. I mean, obviously, I was shipping her with Jon
         and everything. But there was no actual canonical basis for that on any
         level.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
         very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
         queer
         characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
         go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
         their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
         situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
         a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
         always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
         at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
         art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
         it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
         person's mind."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
         been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
         And maybe, I think,
         during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
         different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
         strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
         get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
         distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
         be
         able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
         somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
         something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
         looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
         and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
         is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
         seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
         once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
         not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
         the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
         there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
         </li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
         super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
         of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
         relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
         should take five steps back, and let's just
         focus on these two.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And
         okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
         notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
         figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
         she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
         Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
         things stand out immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even in the modern drabbles, or the
         other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
         she can access that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
         gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
         age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
         she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
         life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
         all the time.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>They wanted to be friends first, but they were so good together that I wanted to be
         able to
         sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
         only get a certain amount of them in canon.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, it's kind of just how I always
         imagined her parents were just going to always be there for her. And we do see that
         in season three, where she's immediately going to bat for them and each
         other.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
         it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
         since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
         until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
         a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
         decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
         this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
         case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
         Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
         bit.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I just tried to stay true to that, I guess, in some
         regard, as far as her relationship went.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, for that chapter, I want to say, like everything
         else in the collection, it was a prompt, but it was something that I didn't want to
         ham-fist it, because Korra's definitely, she's
         traumatized. We see that more than once,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
         it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
         press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
         slaves is super ... I didn't want to
         contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
         [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
         more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
         been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
         thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
         though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
         for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>It was
         partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
         Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a writer, whose name I always mess up. I want to
         say it's coeurdastronaute. They do a lot of Clarke and Lexa
         stuff, but she sets the scene super well with like, "Here's the sky. Here's the
         roads. Here's the this," and I tried to emulate that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's okay to learn from other writers. Like I said
         with coeurdastronaute, everything she writes is like, "I'm in
         love with this. It's great. How can I maybe write something similar to that? What
         parts can I take from this that I want to emulate?"</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Especially with the prompts and setting boundaries like you
         mentioned earlier. It's writing what you want.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Obviously, there's always going to be people who say,
         "I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
         care whether or not they necessarily gel." I'm sure there's
         people ... I feel like I went back a million years ago and looked at the first
         Korrasami fics, just out of curiosity, to see when they were published, and I'm sure
         that they were like episode one, because it's just what people do, and it's great.
         Ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>At the end of season three, we saw that development and
         we saw, especially during Korra's fight with Zaheer, Asami looked the most scared
         out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her
         recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, "That's a little gayer than it maybe
         should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
         of people took that and decided to go with it, especially since
         the relationship was [inaudible 01:00:21], whether or not ...
         Again, and at that time, we didn't know the writer's intention, so it was just
         everybody, or at least Korrasami fans, picking
         up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
         so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
         happen."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
         was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
         possible love interests.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Korrasami's canon. That's
         what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
         up to that point, there really hadn't been
         a whole lot of huge representation for female ships.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
         see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
         god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
         have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I got into forums and fans would
         translate for those of us who didn't speak Hindi. And obviously
         people would answer questions if you asked because you couldn't get everything in
         the translations or the summaries. And during that time, we would talk about the
         plot of the show, what the characters were doing, where we were expecting things to
         go at that time. It was just a lot of the basic things at fandom.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>To
         realizing that there was a community of people who were also interested in
         discussing how these shows and books and games et cetera were failing us, whether
         it
         was in terms of the content or the representation or just releasing new things like
         thought arcs that weren't followed through on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I completely forgot, there was a
         period where I would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because
         I
         don't do that anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment
         with writing and being critical of source materials and so on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess you can say it was a
         nudge to move from passive consumption to active consumption.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But also the fics I had read after the
         show had finished seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ...
         Obviously, it was a really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had
         happened in the gap years that they hadn't shown us for Korra.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I kind of wanted to see that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular,
         and this was surprising for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I
         never really remember to think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like
         there was this big gap available to us for exploration.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So I kind of wanted to explore that and see how
         Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for me I like to see how the characters
         are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to
         them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Partly, I wasn't quite sure what tags to use
         because I was still learning.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And also on being canon-compliant,
         but still ... I was working in an area where there was nothing for canon yet. I'm
         assuming that with the comics now, we'll get more information on that regard. But
         at
         the time, there was nothing in that area. So I wanted it to be known that it was
         still within canon's bounds, but there were going to be things being explored that
         weren't articulated in canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
         And in terms of relationships and love and so forth, it was I guess just coming back
         to what I like to explore in fiction, which is how people are interacting with each
         other, what it means for them. And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
         not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
         audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
         exploration. So I like to see for myself how their worth is existing within these
         relationships, what it means for them and what it can mean for the audience and so
         forth.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Whereas, for
         Asami, Asami didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have
         anyone. So she went back to someone, I
         guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
         for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
         act of violence ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore
         that. It's just fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow
         still find a way to circle back around to the people who have hurt
         them.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
         interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
         we
         kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
         thing about fandom
         and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
         either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
         enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
         in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
         world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
         through.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I think I'd actually forgotten about this until
         someone else had written it in their own fanfiction, which is part of what's so fun
         about reading fanfiction. There are all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on
         right away, but someone else mentions it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the
         world and look at it from a different angle.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
         show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
         just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
         not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
         female-female relationships as well, because a lot of the media already does a lot
         of
         the male-female exploration. And a lot of the purpose of fandom
         is to sort of explore beyond what we're just given.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>You never
         really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
         to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
         with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
         wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
         Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
         because obviously they wouldn't be having as
         much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
         considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
         day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
         from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
         versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
         wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
         identity. But there would definitely be some push
         back, but how would that change based on the setting?
         I made her a little bit more comfortable in
         her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
         shoulder for Jaime
         who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
         well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, definitely when it comes to trying to write it
         realistically as well, but the banter back and forth was very difficult. I read a
         lot of fanfic where it can be very stalkish and when I think about it and I think
         about someone saying it out loud, I just like cringe. My face caves in.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>from the source material where I wanted to kind of
         explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
         because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
         as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to actually put some Game
         of Thrones content on those tags to begin with because back when I was writing it,
         there wasn't a lot really going for it. LGBT fanfics, yeah sure, but
         gender fluid and gender
         related things, it wasn't really there.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Like, where is this content that
         should be out there because it's in the books and why is no one taking this up and
         writing about it?</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think I would want to go
         more into maybe tagging some of the triggers maybe now a days because back then
         there wasn't as much of a discussion around it. Now a days, you have more of a
         discussion around what bigger tags to put in to help people avoid it for instance.
         Now that AO3 has updated its tagging system to include and exclude.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I just find their relationship in
         canon to be so interesting because it was one of
         the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
         pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
         surprised.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
         them being intimate, but it was all
         very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
         vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
         I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
         own instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
         he always had a very strange affinity, but
         like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
         loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
         of view.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think he definitely
         is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
         means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That's definitely
         something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
         of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
         would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
         more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
         me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
         anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
         all of that.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted
         to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
         in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
         that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
         reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
         very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
         and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted something similar, but would still
         make me feel like that, but wanted to make it more intimate and feel like it was
         still just as opening, but with actions and not just with words.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
         them, but I
         don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
         just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
         literally right here.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Sandor and Sansa, I will say that I like their ship name
         as San-San. I do understand the whole
         like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
         romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
         just write a Nora Roberts novel." I'd so read her books if I
         wanted to. I don't need to read them here.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, it's depressingly small. I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
         less fanfic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
         unique friendship/relationship</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I would almost want to just write fic out of
         spite.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I had some really bad, some
         really heated discussions with a friend on my dashboard on Twitter. We just did that,
         like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
         and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
         interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
         dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
         front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
         interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
         not try and put this away. Yeah, it was a whole mess. People
         came out in droves, angry for different reasons.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then people would be like, "Oh, your fanfic is
         this like this one, so why don't you go read this fanfic?" It kind of was a jumping
         off point for me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
         Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
         Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
         no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
         brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
         thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
         wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
         series, the first one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
         know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
         And
         it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
         What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
         And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
         and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
         the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
         that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
         world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
         would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
         maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
         how I got into that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
         written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
         okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
         alone.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But all of a suddenly, this particular set of characters is no longer in the
         picture. So how does that affect everything else? How does Daenerys Targaryen deal
         with a kingdom that is pretty much united with a war hero still on the throne?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
         I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
         outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
         really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
         to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a very hard time
         getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
         motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
         are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
         that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
         top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because one thing as a writer that will pull me completely out of a story is if
         there is a colloquialism that should not belong. Or if
         you're using words, and I'm like, okay, I've never heard that word used on the show,
         so now you've just dropped a bomb in the middle of a wedding cake, and there's cake
         everywhere. It just pulls me out.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
         think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
         little bit of character assassination.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted to kind of show a Sansa who was still herself.
         A Sansa who was willing to not listen to him, who
         understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
         manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
         only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
         run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
         ends are." That's kind of where that idea came from.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She was
         supposed to kind of get lost in the trees, and they were supposed to find her. But
         I
         thought that was a little bit ignominious for her. So then I remembered, Oh,
         Nimeria's wolf pack. I was like, they haven't used that in the show at all, so why
         not?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
         of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
         That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
         delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
         Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
         away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
         one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
         fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
         of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
         if I was a former slave. The one thing I
         would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
         in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
         into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
         anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
         like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
         underused character.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
         thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
         in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
         and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
         unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
         me
         try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
         There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
         improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
         "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
         People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
         right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
         The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
         right.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
         never know. I think my
         characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
         "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
         it may be out of character."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
         divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
         want to get blasted on that one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
         better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
         they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
         would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23].</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
         dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
         that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
         Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
         beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
         thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And like she says in the fic even
         if I get bit by a lizard-lion or I starve, that's my choice. But it won't be going
         back
         to a ruined Winterfell to marry a legitimized bastard.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was my take on the scene where Brienne and Pod meet her in the tavern, where
         she seems to be at first a little surprised, a little relieved, and then you kind
         of
         see her shut down a bit.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But in my mind, I
         didn't think she didn't want it because she didn't necessarily trust Brienne, it was
         more because Peter would never let her go. Even if this person said, "I'm going to
         help you," he would never allow that, because he
         wants control of her, and that is something that she realizes, because she's not
         an idiot. She's seen this man in King's Landing, she sees how
         he operates. She sees how he operates in the Eyrie. If he doesn't have total control
         of her, he's not going to allow it. And the best way to do that would be to get rid
         of these two people. And she doesn't want anyone to die for her. So that was kind
         of
         my read on that situation.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It doesn't matter if it's to save my life. Even if you
         said that okay, "This is the only thing you can do to survive," at this point, she's
         run. She's re-discovered her strength. She's
         done something that she didn't think she could do. She got away
         for a time. So, at this point she's just like, "No, I can't do it. I won't do it."
         That was kind of that whole, what that
         episode was about was Sansa really re-discovering herself, and what she could
         do.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So yeah, [Missandei]'s such an interesting character. There's
         so much about her that could be written that isn't written. I just kind of wanted
         to
         investigate a little bit. What would life have been like for this character?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
         Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
         without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
         something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
         times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
         I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
         to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
         think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
         sentiment.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
         seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
         woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
         anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
         back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
         Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
         slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
         she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
         jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
         great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
         I've seen it before.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's a smile of, I
         can't think of the word, but being resigned to my fate. And if this is it, then this
         is it. And like I say, she recognizes in Cersei the same evil that she saw in
         Astapor where she's kind of like, "No, you
         would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
         think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
         better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
         are not. You are exactly like them." And in the end, she kind
         of wants to let her know. It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
         that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me. I see exactly what
         you are.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Like I
         said, as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
         be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
         be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself. Kind of like, I hate to use the
         comparison, but if you ever get out of a really bad relationship, and you're just
         like, "No, never again. I know the signs. I will never let that happen to me again."
         And for her of course it's more extreme,
         from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
         decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
         getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
         found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
         myself.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
         the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
         so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
         Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
         and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But I can
         see, especially in Season Five, and Six, and Seven, where you see Jon Snow, Sansa
         Stark, because these two characters kind of get back together in the show. When
         they're together, you can see their dynamic in everything else. And they look good
         together. That's always a good thing. It's always big when it comes to shipping, who
         looks good with who.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
         active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
         especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
         and
         putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
         I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
         convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
         arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then I wrote a piece called [inaudible 00:05:42], which was sort of like a revisiting
         of what does... I guess it was actually about immigration, it's just I never really
         ever got around to doing a piece about immigration system, but somebody had a bad
         take about immigration in America in a piece of fanfic and I was like, "God, that's
         a really bad understanding of that friend. That is utopian and wrong."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
         very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
         you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
         original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
         through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
         and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
         with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
         get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
         you.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was coming into my own politically, I was becoming my own political individual in
         a way I hadn't been before. Like I had politics, but this is around the time that
         I'm really radicalized, and just me engaging with those contexts.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
         a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
         different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
         in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
         and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
         looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I come away from Korra feeling like, "This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy
         that there's not homophobia in a world with gender in the like weird way that... In
         ways that still reflect our I think gender and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the
         way that we have a sense of gender. Big, capital G Gender. And so I thought like,
         "What does it mean to have culture in the context of... What does it mean to be a
         cosmopolitan city where... There's both a degree of marginalization for like the Northern
         Water Tribe closing... Not so much that rules that are really intended to enforce
         gender norms are going to be there. And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a
         different understanding of gender in context," yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
         progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
         man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
         and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
         said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
         understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
         woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
         This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
         institution itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So to me, Hiroshi's both a man that would destroy his children for the things he believes,
         and in some sense for his own power. But also a man who genuinely is providing aid
         and comfort and resources for fighting for what he views as liberation, and that liberation's
         probably genuine at some level. I think it's fair to say that there is a political
         bender-like supremacy at the beginning. I mean there is, we know there's a bender
         supremacy at the beginning of The Legend of Korra. And so that's how I understand
         Hiroshi.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to give a sense of what is the politics of the Northern Water Tribe? And
         I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water Tribe,
         or is not criminalized anymore. Also I wanted to say this is a different relationship.
         But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give
         up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I know what our reactionary politics is like, I think I'd start around the
         time that Kuvira is beginning to gain power. I'd write it as a story that talks about
         immigration, and talks about sweeping panic and fear that spill off of that. I'd probably
         talk about gender through those lenses, and I'd probably talk about humanity in a
         slightly more complex... I'd probably make it a story that... I'd probably both use
         modern messages to say that, I'd probably talk more about police state, and police
         state as endless spying networks where you don't know when you're being spied on and
         when you're not, and endless police states</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
         love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
         stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
         of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
         of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
         "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
         who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
         of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
         seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
         once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
         not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
         the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
         there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
         </li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
         super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
         of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
         relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
         should take five steps back, and let's just
         focus on these two.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
         it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
         press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
         slaves is super ... I didn't want to
         contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
         [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
         more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
         been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
         thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Especially with the prompts and setting boundaries like you
         mentioned earlier. It's writing what you want.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>To
         realizing that there was a community of people who were also interested in
         discussing how these shows and books and games et cetera were failing us, whether
         it
         was in terms of the content or the representation or just releasing new things like
         thought arcs that weren't followed through on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I completely forgot, there was a
         period where I would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because
         I
         don't do that anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment
         with writing and being critical of source materials and so on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
         And in terms of relationships and love and so forth, it was I guess just coming back
         to what I like to explore in fiction, which is how people are interacting with each
         other, what it means for them. And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
         not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
         audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
         exploration. So I like to see for myself how their worth is existing within these
         relationships, what it means for them and what it can mean for the audience and so
         forth.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
         interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
         we
         kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
         thing about fandom
         and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
         either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
         enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
         in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
         world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
         through.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I think I'd actually forgotten about this until
         someone else had written it in their own fanfiction, which is part of what's so fun
         about reading fanfiction. There are all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on
         right away, but someone else mentions it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the
         world and look at it from a different angle.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
         show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
         just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
         not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
         female-female relationships as well, because a lot of the media already does a lot
         of
         the male-female exploration. And a lot of the purpose of fandom
         is to sort of explore beyond what we're just given.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to actually put some Game
         of Thrones content on those tags to begin with because back when I was writing it,
         there wasn't a lot really going for it. LGBT fanfics, yeah sure, but
         gender fluid and gender
         related things, it wasn't really there.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Like, where is this content that
         should be out there because it's in the books and why is no one taking this up and
         writing about it?</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
         them being intimate, but it was all
         very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
         vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
         I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
         own instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, it's depressingly small. I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
         less fanfic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
         unique friendship/relationship</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I would almost want to just write fic out of
         spite.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
         of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
         That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
         delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
         Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
         away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
         one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
         fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
         of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
         if I was a former slave. The one thing I
         would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
         in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
         into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
         anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
         like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
         underused character.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
         better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
         they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
         would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23].</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
         dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
         that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
         Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
         beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
         thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And like she says in the fic even
         if I get bit by a lizard-lion or I starve, that's my choice. But it won't be going
         back
         to a ruined Winterfell to marry a legitimized bastard.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It doesn't matter if it's to save my life. Even if you
         said that okay, "This is the only thing you can do to survive," at this point, she's
         run. She's re-discovered her strength. She's
         done something that she didn't think she could do. She got away
         for a time. So, at this point she's just like, "No, I can't do it. I won't do it."
         That was kind of that whole, what that
         episode was about was Sansa really re-discovering herself, and what she could
         do.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
         Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
         without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
         something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
         times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
         I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
         to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
         think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
         sentiment.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
         seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
         woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
         anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
         back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
         Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
         slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
         she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
         jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
         great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
         I've seen it before.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's a smile of, I
         can't think of the word, but being resigned to my fate. And if this is it, then this
         is it. And like I say, she recognizes in Cersei the same evil that she saw in
         Astapor where she's kind of like, "No, you
         would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
         think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
         better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
         are not. You are exactly like them." And in the end, she kind
         of wants to let her know. It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
         that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me. I see exactly what
         you are.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Like I
         said, as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
         be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
         be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself. Kind of like, I hate to use the
         comparison, but if you ever get out of a really bad relationship, and you're just
         like, "No, never again. I know the signs. I will never let that happen to me again."
         And for her of course it's more extreme,
         from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
         decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
         getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
         found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
         myself.</li>

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
         there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
         feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
         a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
         but it's good.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon
         compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant,"
         as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant
         sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense
         to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a
         story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine
         that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on
         what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now.
         That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories
         that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I imagine that it's because... It makes sense to tell a friendship story with characters
         who are already very close friends, and characters who are becoming close friends.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I mean, canon queer relationship is more common because there is canon queer relationship.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>because it looks to me here that what you're seeing is a movement from seeing the
         word girlfriend in a context of a text that's about a set of texts about relationships
         in a more heterosexual perspective, in a story about women. Because it looks to me
         that this is a story that, if you see jealous there, that looks like I'm looking at
         a piece that's from Korra's point of view. But then if I'm looking at boyfriend, I'm
         also thinking about Korra and Mako.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, of course, you have the Targaryen
         colors, which are black, which are mourning colors according to the Western
         culture. And all of it kind of comes together. And, of course,
         Rajput culture is known for its red, its vibrant, blood red. And obviously, that's
         a
         Targaryen color.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But within this particular fic, as I said earlier, I
         really wanted to already have that tension. Especially that religious tension between
         Jon and
         Sansa. And have that difference, where both of them and neither of them are
         willing to compromise on that.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the regional tensions, I think, are already
         there in the canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, I mean, we don't know if she relies more on
         her religion because she left her homeland, and came to the North. And just
         wanted some desperate way, something to rely on that's her family, or that
         reminded her of home. But to me, at least, I can imagine, especially the actual
         Jodhaa, going to Akbar's Islamic court. And basically being all alone, and not
         having very many allies. And finding some sort of a solace in her religion of
         Hinduism.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
         very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
         queer
         characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
         go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
         their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
         situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And
         okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
         notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
         figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
         she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
         Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
         things stand out immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even in the modern drabbles, or the
         other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
         she can access that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
         gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
         age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
         she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
         life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
         all the time.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, it's kind of just how I always
         imagined her parents were just going to always be there for her. And we do see that
         in season three, where she's immediately going to bat for them and each
         other.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I just tried to stay true to that, I guess, in some
         regard, as far as her relationship went.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, for that chapter, I want to say, like everything
         else in the collection, it was a prompt, but it was something that I didn't want to
         ham-fist it, because Korra's definitely, she's
         traumatized. We see that more than once,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
         though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
         for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
         was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
         possible love interests.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Korrasami's canon. That's
         what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
         up to that point, there really hadn't been
         a whole lot of huge representation for female ships.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
         see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
         god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
         have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And also on being canon-compliant,
         but still ... I was working in an area where there was nothing for canon yet. I'm
         assuming that with the comics now, we'll get more information on that regard. But
         at
         the time, there was nothing in that area. So I wanted it to be known that it was
         still within canon's bounds, but there were going to be things being explored that
         weren't articulated in canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted
         to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
         in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
         that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
         reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
         very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
         and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted something similar, but would still
         make me feel like that, but wanted to make it more intimate and feel like it was
         still just as opening, but with actions and not just with words.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
         I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
         outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
         really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
         to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a very hard time
         getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
         motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
         are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
         that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
         top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because one thing as a writer that will pull me completely out of a story is if
         there is a colloquialism that should not belong. Or if
         you're using words, and I'm like, okay, I've never heard that word used on the show,
         so now you've just dropped a bomb in the middle of a wedding cake, and there's cake
         everywhere. It just pulls me out.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
         the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
         so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
         Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
         and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But I can
         see, especially in Season Five, and Six, and Seven, where you see Jon Snow, Sansa
         Stark, because these two characters kind of get back together in the show. When
         they're together, you can see their dynamic in everything else. And they look good
         together. That's always a good thing. It's always big when it comes to shipping, who
         looks good with who.</li>

<div class="interview-search-analysis">
   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
         very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
         you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
         original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
         through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
         and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
         with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
         get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
         you.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
         clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
         Jon is raised a Targaryen.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>A Jon who would grow up in a Targaryen
         court would look very different in the Targaryen [inaudible
         00:53:09] than with a Targaryen father.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the thing is, as much as he looked like Ned on a physical level, Ned is not the
         Ned that we see in canon. Because he's very much a person who has been basically
         warring for however Jon has been alive.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, actually, Aishwarya Rai, who plays Jodhaa,
         does not have brown eyes. She has hazel eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But Sansa, she
         didn't have any such love interests. I mean, obviously, I was shipping her with Jon
         and everything. But there was no actual canonical basis for that on any
         level.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
         been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
         And maybe, I think,
         during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
         different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
         strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>They wanted to be friends first, but they were so good together that I wanted to be
         able to
         sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Obviously, there's always going to be people who say,
         "I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
         care whether or not they necessarily gel." I'm sure there's
         people ... I feel like I went back a million years ago and looked at the first
         Korrasami fics, just out of curiosity, to see when they were published, and I'm sure
         that they were like episode one, because it's just what people do, and it's great.
         Ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
         Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
         because obviously they wouldn't be having as
         much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
         considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
         day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
         from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
         versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
         wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
         identity. But there would definitely be some push
         back, but how would that change based on the setting?
         I made her a little bit more comfortable in
         her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
         shoulder for Jaime
         who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
         well.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
         Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
         Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
         no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
         brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
         thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
         wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
         series, the first one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
         know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
         And
         it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
         What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
         And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
         and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
         the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
         that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
         world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
         would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
         maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
         how I got into that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
         written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
         okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
         alone.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But all of a suddenly, this particular set of characters is no longer in the
         picture. So how does that affect everything else? How does Daenerys Targaryen deal
         with a kingdom that is pretty much united with a war hero still on the throne?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
         think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
         little bit of character assassination.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted to kind of show a Sansa who was still herself.
         A Sansa who was willing to not listen to him, who
         understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
         manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
         only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
         run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
         ends are." That's kind of where that idea came from.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She was
         supposed to kind of get lost in the trees, and they were supposed to find her. But
         I
         thought that was a little bit ignominious for her. So then I remembered, Oh,
         Nimeria's wolf pack. I was like, they haven't used that in the show at all, so why
         not?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
         divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
         want to get blasted on that one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It doesn't matter if it's to save my life. Even if you
         said that okay, "This is the only thing you can do to survive," at this point, she's
         run. She's re-discovered her strength. She's
         done something that she didn't think she could do. She got away
         for a time. So, at this point she's just like, "No, I can't do it. I won't do it."
         That was kind of that whole, what that
         episode was about was Sansa really re-discovering herself, and what she could
         do.</li>

   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I was under the impression, reading or engaging with this text, I came away with
         this feeling like the Northern Water Tribe is somewhat... very different from the
         rest of the world, and there are ways that it plays as... I don't know if it was textual
         or sort of fan-driven more, but I remember coming away with this feeling that there
         is a marginalized subjectivity in the Northern Water Tribe. And so telling this story
         about difference in culture, and we'll get to... I'll get to Korra's upbringing a
         little bit later, because you're going to ask about 10 minutes later about Korra's
         upbringing. But I want to... Basically that I think Korra's upbringing is particularly
         reflective of that culture, yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I come away from Korra feeling like, "This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy
         that there's not homophobia in a world with gender in the like weird way that... In
         ways that still reflect our I think gender and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the
         way that we have a sense of gender. Big, capital G Gender. And so I thought like,
         "What does it mean to have culture in the context of... What does it mean to be a
         cosmopolitan city where... There's both a degree of marginalization for like the Northern
         Water Tribe closing... Not so much that rules that are really intended to enforce
         gender norms are going to be there. And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a
         different understanding of gender in context," yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Asami probably can't like cook...because I think it's either canonical or in fanon,
         and I kind of like that, because I like the notion that... I like the notion that
         someone who's very good at some things, but just not good at other things.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that this is a piece that comes from a weird part of what I understood about
         that world. To me, Korra grows up in a compound with people who are older than her,
         who aren't likely to tell her the truth about things. Because the White Lotus is an
         organization of people who are fundamentally keeping her apart. And I remember being
         like, "Oh, these folks are not going to tell a child about queer sexuality." Particularly
         sexuality is a hard topic, you grow up in that kind of compound in a world where queer
         identities are looked down on, you're going to come away with this very strange view
         about that. And you might just be told nothing.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
         her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
         Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
         is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
         dress herself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>In the context of this piece, a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois
         radical is that I'm not going to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really
         have a sense of class politics at the time, or have the beginnings of that study.
         That's only beginning to be born</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also, if you're looking at a subtext, my people they were like, "Oh yeah, I want to
         tell this story, I want to finish this story." And there's a degree to which it a
         queer reading, there's this political tendency to look at fiction and say, "I am going
         to tell the story you didn't." And so during the subtext period, you've already got
         these people who are basically being like, "Yo, I'm going to tell this story.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
         I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
         make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
         heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
         fandoms. And I think that's probably because we don't have one
         main character and one side character that's like the sidekick to the main
         character, both of them being male. You don't have that here.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because
         I know that a lot of people had mentioned that it was at the beginning of Season
         Six. Like, when a couple of trailers came out regarding Sansa meeting up with
         somebody in the North. It was kind of staging with Ramsay Bolton. That Jon Snow and
         Sansa Stark fandom kind of really took off. And it was the beginning of Season Six
         that it really, properly emerged. So, it would be interesting to see if there is a
         cookie cutter point that you can identify like, this is where the general public
         kind of suddenly said, "Oh, this is the moment."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
         only get a certain amount of them in canon.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>At the end of season three, we saw that development and
         we saw, especially during Korra's fight with Zaheer, Asami looked the most scared
         out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her
         recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, "That's a little gayer than it maybe
         should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
         of people took that and decided to go with it, especially since
         the relationship was [inaudible 01:00:21], whether or not ...
         Again, and at that time, we didn't know the writer's intention, so it was just
         everybody, or at least Korrasami fans, picking
         up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
         so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
         happen."</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I kind of wanted to see that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular,
         and this was surprising for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I
         never really remember to think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like
         there was this big gap available to us for exploration.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So I kind of wanted to explore that and see how
         Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for me I like to see how the characters
         are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to
         them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And also on being canon-compliant,
         but still ... I was working in an area where there was nothing for canon yet. I'm
         assuming that with the comics now, we'll get more information on that regard. But
         at
         the time, there was nothing in that area. So I wanted it to be known that it was
         still within canon's bounds, but there were going to be things being explored that
         weren't articulated in canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Whereas, for
         Asami, Asami didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have
         anyone. So she went back to someone, I
         guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
         for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
         act of violence ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore
         that. It's just fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow
         still find a way to circle back around to the people who have hurt
         them.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>You never
         really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
         to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
         with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
         wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>from the source material where I wanted to kind of
         explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
         because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
         as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I just find their relationship in
         canon to be so interesting because it was one of
         the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
         pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
         surprised.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
         he always had a very strange affinity, but
         like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
         loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
         of view.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think he definitely
         is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
         means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That's definitely
         something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
         of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
         would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
         more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
         me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
         anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
         all of that.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
         them, but I
         don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
         just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
         literally right here.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was my take on the scene where Brienne and Pod meet her in the tavern, where
         she seems to be at first a little surprised, a little relieved, and then you kind
         of
         see her shut down a bit.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But in my mind, I
         didn't think she didn't want it because she didn't necessarily trust Brienne, it was
         more because Peter would never let her go. Even if this person said, "I'm going to
         help you," he would never allow that, because he
         wants control of her, and that is something that she realizes, because she's not
         an idiot. She's seen this man in King's Landing, she sees how
         he operates. She sees how he operates in the Eyrie. If he doesn't have total control
         of her, he's not going to allow it. And the best way to do that would be to get rid
         of these two people. And she doesn't want anyone to die for her. So that was kind
         of
         my read on that situation.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So yeah, [Missandei]'s such an interesting character. There's
         so much about her that could be written that isn't written. I just kind of wanted
         to
         investigate a little bit. What would life have been like for this character?</li>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>People are like, "Oh..." When people talk about RWBY, the way they talk about the
         White Fang is the way they talk about radical politics. And I don't know if they realize
         it, but I always get really annoyed, because this is like bad political theory. It's
         very normal American political theory, but it's also bad. It's very much like, "Oh,
         there's no justification for violence," it's like, "I don't agree."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also I think it's when fiction ends, it does draw people who are like, "Oh, I want
         to write more on this subject, I want to play with these concepts again." There's
         also a distinct un-ended-ness</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad.
         But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want
         to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want
         to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that!
         I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.[inaudible 00:47:08]
         what are other ways we can imagine it?</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And that creates fanon, which means you get this whole long space of people being
         like, "Oh yeah, I am writing about this content of fanon in this alternate universe,
         I'm going to write a piece about a radio show</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of [inaudible 00:47:39], some
         of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion that comes out of that. So
         I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and I think that it's liberating
         for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I don't know, I don't know if I'd use the fluff and angst tags anymore, just because
         I don't talk about my literature in those terms as much anymore, as I used to, but...
         Largely because nobody...You don't use those tags as much anymore in my view, like
         we don't talk about... Those are very much Fanfiction.net-y terms that pulled over,
         I don't see them as I used to.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> a [inaudible 00:57:08] of the audience that come later are less interested in acknowledging
         or talking about race. Given this is a proportion, I don't know if [inaudible 00:57:24]
         but more people as a fandom and those few people aren't interested in talking about
         race in ways that people who had been there before were, and those people who were
         there before continued to talk about race, or if there is an effectively gentrifying
         mmoment that a white fandom comes in, pushes out a fandom of color. I don't know how
         this tag is used, so I would feel hesitant to say something definite. But I find that
         a little bit troublesome.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>The context is basically just, yeah, things you would expect people would say on a
         date, things you'd expect people to do on a date, things that writers do when they
         run out of words, like chuckle.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also this more mature understanding of a relationship, seeing their partner as a dork
         versus like, seeing them as cute. And obviously you see your partner is cute for a
         long time after you start dating, that... Viewing someone as a dork is a more developed
         sense of what a relationship is.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I've also recently published work in Fleabag, which
         was one of the fandoms that I had to write for for my Yuletide assignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
         the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
         Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
         film."</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
         person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
         universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
         view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
         you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
         of
         view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
         what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
         more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
         because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
         other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
         fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
         particular tag.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
         a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
         always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
         at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
         art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
         it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
         person's mind."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
         get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
         distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
         be
         able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
         somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
         something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
         looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
         and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
         is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
         it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
         since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
         until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
         a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
         decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
         this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
         case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
         Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
         bit.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>It was
         partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
         Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a writer, whose name I always mess up. I want to
         say it's coeurdastronaute. They do a lot of Clarke and Lexa
         stuff, but she sets the scene super well with like, "Here's the sky. Here's the
         roads. Here's the this," and I tried to emulate that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's okay to learn from other writers. Like I said
         with coeurdastronaute, everything she writes is like, "I'm in
         love with this. It's great. How can I maybe write something similar to that? What
         parts can I take from this that I want to emulate?"</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I got into forums and fans would
         translate for those of us who didn't speak Hindi. And obviously
         people would answer questions if you asked because you couldn't get everything in
         the translations or the summaries. And during that time, we would talk about the
         plot of the show, what the characters were doing, where we were expecting things to
         go at that time. It was just a lot of the basic things at fandom.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess you can say it was a
         nudge to move from passive consumption to active consumption.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But also the fics I had read after the
         show had finished seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ...
         Obviously, it was a really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had
         happened in the gap years that they hadn't shown us for Korra.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Partly, I wasn't quite sure what tags to use
         because I was still learning.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, definitely when it comes to trying to write it
         realistically as well, but the banter back and forth was very difficult. I read a
         lot of fanfic where it can be very stalkish and when I think about it and I think
         about someone saying it out loud, I just like cringe. My face caves in.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think I would want to go
         more into maybe tagging some of the triggers maybe now a days because back then
         there wasn't as much of a discussion around it. Now a days, you have more of a
         discussion around what bigger tags to put in to help people avoid it for instance.
         Now that AO3 has updated its tagging system to include and exclude.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Sandor and Sansa, I will say that I like their ship name
         as San-San. I do understand the whole
         like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
         romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
         just write a Nora Roberts novel." I'd so read her books if I
         wanted to. I don't need to read them here.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I had some really bad, some
         really heated discussions with a friend on my dashboard on Twitter. We just did that,
         like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
         and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
         interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
         dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
         front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
         interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
         not try and put this away. Yeah, it was a whole mess. People
         came out in droves, angry for different reasons.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then people would be like, "Oh, your fanfic is
         this like this one, so why don't you go read this fanfic?" It kind of was a jumping
         off point for me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
         delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
         Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
         away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
         one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
         fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
         of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
         if I was a former slave. The one thing I
         would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
         in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
         into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
         anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
         like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
         underused character.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
         thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
         in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
         and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
         unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
         me
         try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
         There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
         improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
         "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
         People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
         right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
         never know. I think my
         characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
         "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
         it may be out of character."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
         divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
         want to get blasted on that one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
         the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
         so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
         Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
         and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
         active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
         especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
         and
         putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't want to be like, "Ah, but I'm writing the version of this character that's
         a woman." I hate that. I know that that's permissible with the meta text but I don't
         want to be part of that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world
         and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting,"
         instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with
         it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's
         also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that
         I really was not before.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
         about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
         those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and I
         couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing I
         was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I guess the first three, they're basic tags. You want to read angst, here's angst.
         You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy
         but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then the last one's a content warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see
         homophobia. I can't not publish a story about homophobia.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of
         the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was
         more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll
         do alternate points of view."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't know if I thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought
         about it as a storytelling tool obviously that helps power [inaudible 00:17:00], not
         necessarily about the story if it makes sense. I wasn't telling you things that had
         happened in the past, to teach you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This
         is what's haunting the characters, this is what the characters can't escape from in
         a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you
         know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>If I remember correctly, this was about writing about suicide. I had been in a fight
         for a very long time. And I was nearly constantly suicidal. And so writing this piece
         was an engaging... It was obviously triggering.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
         love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
         stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
         of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
         of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
         "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
         who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
         of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that people writing about suffering and happiness, a lot of things happen
         in love stories in general, particularly in WlW and MlM stuff. Well, I don't know
         if MlM, I don't read it very much just because one, I am not a man, and two, so much
         MlM stuff is kind of uncomfortable? A lot it's very clearly written by women.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon
         compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant,"
         as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant
         sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense
         to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a
         story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine
         that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on
         what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now.
         That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories
         that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And to be fair, omega and alpha as being there in the far right column. I don't really
         understand ABO [alpha, beta, omega] as in general, so I can't talk. They're not as
         inherently sexual. They definitely struck me as relatively sexual, and that's not</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But a few years later when I was, I think,
         13, my friend introduced me to like crack Lord Of The Rings fiction.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
         person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
         universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I chose to make it Desi because I am Desi. and I wanted
         to experience it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I mean, I think the
         choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
         setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
         trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
         for it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it was football RPF
         (real person fic) fanfiction. Which was very interesting, because I think it was
         just after the 2018 World Cup.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
         view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
         you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
         of
         view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
         what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
         more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah. I mean, I really do
         feel like there aren't that many second person point of views that kind of allow you
         to immerse yourself into that person, or into that character.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was literally
         just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
         as
         South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
         Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But when I was making the
         actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
         actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
         identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
         identify.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
         and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
         that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
         ideas from.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Just building that list kind of helps me know where and how
         I'm getting the material, and the assumptions that I've made throughout the fanfic.
         And, therefore, helps make it easier to kind of discuss it later, I think.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
         be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one of the
         primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
         sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it is an angsty fic. It's not like a comedy, there is angst.
         And it's one of the major points of the entire fanfic.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, this fic is obviously
         dramatized and all that. But the essential part of it is that both of them have
         this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
         that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
         see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
         very difficult way of going through life. And it's not
         necessarily a happy life that you lead when you have that kind of a
         mentality.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then
         the fact that the alternate universe for a modern setting is so
         [inaudible 01:07:54]. Which, to me, is very interesting.
         Because I tend to go out of my way to avoid modern alternate universes, because I
         personally don't like them.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, I think one of
         the major ones is fluff.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, you do
         see a lot of angst, though.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I didn't necessarily want to
         do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to
         a
         point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
         each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
         all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
         can't."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I think for
         shorter things, there's a challenge in that you have, I think most of them ended up
         being 200-400 words, so you have to do an entire story in that time. You have to
         make somebody care about things that are happening in much fewer words, and make it
         more impactful in less amount of time. If you have 10,000 words to set up a
         situation and resolve it, and all that, it's definitely different from, "Here's just
         basically a gut punch of a story, and you maybe don't get the whole thing."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a couple that, I don't
         remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
         [inaudible 00:09:21] on purpose, so that it had to be
         like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
         was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
         think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
         prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
         I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
         I can sort of tailor it to that,"</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
         a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
         always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
         at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
         art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
         it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
         person's mind."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even though it's 400 chapters, it's book-length. It's like a
         normal book length. It's easily digestible, and each thing's its own thing, so if
         you want to stop it and come back to it later, you can. People do usually, if you're
         feeling a specific mood, and go find that specific one and just go through a couple
         of those. I like that it's sort of, you don't have to have a super amount of
         emotional investment in it, like super long, 10-chapter fics that are 100,000
         words.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Like yes, it's very good. I enjoy it. But sometimes, I'm just in
         the mood for something light and I like that I can provide that for people who want
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, the fact that
         it was short meant that I did only have a certain amount of words to deal with
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. Well, absolutely
         part of it was wish fulfillment. I've never been in any sort of relationship, so it
         was like, "Okay, this is might what it be like." But also, I'm a big fan of the fact
         that, of using fanfiction, or TV shows, or movies, or any of that as escapism.
         You look out your window and things are just not
         good a lot of the time,
         so I really like reading things that are just
         soft and maybe things aren't so terrible for them where they are, and just sort
         of getting lost in the idea of, they can just relax. They've been through so
         much, they deserve a little bit of something that's not going to hurt them, with
         somebody who definitely wants the same for them, who wants the same for
         themselves. I tried to make that as a focus. Yeah, I just
         really wanted that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
         different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
         know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
         way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
         So, I tried to mix it up on occasion.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even in the modern drabbles, or the
         other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
         she can access that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Things like that, you notice immediately, but also that
         it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
         I
         don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
         trying to get portrayed.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I
         try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
         to live with a person she loves, doing
         something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
         complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
         obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
         yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
         be happy.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
         serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
         just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
         things that made me super uncomfortable.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I wanted it to, like everything
         else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
         to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, these big cartoons that are for kids are doing more
         for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
         kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
         much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust."</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But
         basically where you would participate with one fan writing a line, the next fan
         writing another line and so on and so forth. So that was the first time that I
         actually wrote anything fandom related.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And then there was a bit of a lull until my delving into the
         Indian forums. And there we would do the meta analysis and satirical writings and
         so
         on. </li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I completely forgot, there was a
         period where I would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because
         I
         don't do that anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment
         with writing and being critical of source materials and so on.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I started writing and initially my own fanfic, so self insert fan
         fic when I was like maybe about 10 years old.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>You never
         really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
         to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
         with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
         wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
         Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
         because obviously they wouldn't be having as
         much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
         considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
         day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
         from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
         versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
         wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
         identity. But there would definitely be some push
         back, but how would that change based on the setting?
         I made her a little bit more comfortable in
         her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
         shoulder for Jaime
         who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
         well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>from the source material where I wanted to kind of
         explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
         because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
         as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
         actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
         how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
         how she had gotten to living with Jaime.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
         way and being very new, if you're very new into
         like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
         a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
         higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
         or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
         You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
         anything.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That's definitely
         something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
         of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
         would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
         more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
         me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
         anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
         all of that.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted
         to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
         in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
         that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
         wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
         their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
         that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
         work through those emotions with me.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
         guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
         to when I came out to them.
         I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
         of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
         having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
         leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
         little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of write it as like a self-fulfilling
         fantasy as well as like how I would have pictured them actually going through
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I learned how much writing a one shot sounds good and all in
         practice, but then it ends up opening all these other doors of should I write more,
         should I write less. I don't know what I should be doing with this.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was
         definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
         back and explore myself with fan
         fic if I needed to as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Most Game of Thrones fanfic is incredibly hetero
         normative and it's a lot of university AU, high school AU and
         I'm like, "What about literally anything else?" I did a modern universe
         [inaudible 00:37:49] Please, literally anything
         else.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And I actually really liked a
         show called Xena: Warrior Princess. That was kind of my very first fandom. I really
         liked, see I can't even remember now, Ares and Gabrielle. I wrote a fanfiction
         about them that was set in modern times. That was my very first fan
         fic.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>X-Men comics. And I wrote a story, once
         again, set in modern times. I kind of do this a lot. I take characters out of their
         setting and transpose them into reality.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
         know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
         And
         it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
         What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
         And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
         and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
         the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
         that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
         world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
         would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
         maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
         how I got into that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Let me just zero in on
         the one moment that I think is pivotal, and just kind of get that out, and then
         leave it alone. Because a lot of my drabbles, they are parts of much bigger fics.
         I
         just haven't posted them.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
         written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
         okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
         alone.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
         "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
         People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
         right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Fix-it, cause they're mostly fix-it.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Fluff and angst, I
         cannot write straight fluff. I'm incapable. You have to have pain with your
         pleasure. I can't do it.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because it has to hurt
         if it's to heal.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
         dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
         that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
         Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
         the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
         so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
         Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
         and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But I think people really enjoy the Jaime Lannister, Brienne of
         Tarth is kind of like the person, your frenemy. The person you love to hate.
         I would rescue you if you're falling off a cliff, but I'd probably punch you in the
         stomach when I got you back on solid land for being in that position to begin
         with.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I like the modern setting. Modern setting seems to be the most
         common one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
         active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
         especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
         and
         putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>canon divergence, angst, love, romance, smut. Not really. Everything seems to be kind
         of
         right where it should be, based on what I've seen. I'm trying to think of a tag that
         may
         be missing. No. Fluff, yeah, fluff's there, angst, romance. No, I think everything
         is
         there. You just randomly go on AO3, that's what you'd see.</li>

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I guess the first three, they're basic tags. You want to read angst, here's angst.
         You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy
         but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that people writing about suffering and happiness, a lot of things happen
         in love stories in general, particularly in WlW and MlM stuff. Well, I don't know
         if MlM, I don't read it very much just because one, I am not a man, and two, so much
         MlM stuff is kind of uncomfortable? A lot it's very clearly written by women.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it is an angsty fic. It's not like a comedy, there is angst.
         And it's one of the major points of the entire fanfic.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, this fic is obviously
         dramatized and all that. But the essential part of it is that both of them have
         this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
         that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
         see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
         very difficult way of going through life. And it's not
         necessarily a happy life that you lead when you have that kind of a
         mentality.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, you do
         see a lot of angst, though.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Fluff and angst, I
         cannot write straight fluff. I'm incapable. You have to have pain with your

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I guess the first three, they're basic tags. You want to read angst, here's angst.
         You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy
         but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
         love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
         stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
         of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
         of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
         "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
         who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
         of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, I think one of
         the major ones is fluff.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Like yes, it's very good. I enjoy it. But sometimes, I'm just in
         the mood for something light and I like that I can provide that for people who want
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. Well, absolutely
         part of it was wish fulfillment. I've never been in any sort of relationship, so it
         was like, "Okay, this is might what it be like." But also, I'm a big fan of the fact
         that, of using fanfiction, or TV shows, or movies, or any of that as escapism.
         You look out your window and things are just not
         good a lot of the time,
         so I really like reading things that are just
         soft and maybe things aren't so terrible for them where they are, and just sort
         of getting lost in the idea of, they can just relax. They've been through so
         much, they deserve a little bit of something that's not going to hurt them, with
         somebody who definitely wants the same for them, who wants the same for
         themselves. I tried to make that as a focus. Yeah, I just
         really wanted that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I
         try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
         to live with a person she loves, doing
         something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
         complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
         obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
         yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
         be happy.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
         serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
         just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
         things that made me super uncomfortable.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I wanted it to, like everything
         else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
         to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Fluff and angst, I
         cannot write straight fluff. I'm incapable. You have to have pain with your

   <ul>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I didn't necessarily want to
         do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to
         a
         point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
         each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
         all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
         can't."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I think for
         shorter things, there's a challenge in that you have, I think most of them ended up
         being 200-400 words, so you have to do an entire story in that time. You have to
         make somebody care about things that are happening in much fewer words, and make it
         more impactful in less amount of time. If you have 10,000 words to set up a
         situation and resolve it, and all that, it's definitely different from, "Here's just
         basically a gut punch of a story, and you maybe don't get the whole thing."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a couple that, I don't
         remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
         [inaudible 00:09:21] on purpose, so that it had to be
         like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even though it's 400 chapters, it's book-length. It's like a
         normal book length. It's easily digestible, and each thing's its own thing, so if
         you want to stop it and come back to it later, you can. People do usually, if you're
         feeling a specific mood, and go find that specific one and just go through a couple
         of those. I like that it's sort of, you don't have to have a super amount of
         emotional investment in it, like super long, 10-chapter fics that are 100,000
         words.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, the fact that
         it was short meant that I did only have a certain amount of words to deal with
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
         different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
         know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
         way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
         So, I tried to mix it up on occasion.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Things like that, you notice immediately, but also that
         it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
         I
         don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
         trying to get portrayed.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Let me just zero in on
         the one moment that I think is pivotal, and just kind of get that out, and then
         leave it alone. Because a lot of my drabbles, they are parts of much bigger fics.
         I
         just haven't posted them.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
         written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
         okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
         alone.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of

      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
         know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
         And
         it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
         What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
         And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
         and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
         the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
         that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
         world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
         would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
         maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
         how I got into that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then the last one's a content warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see
         homophobia. I can't not publish a story about homophobia.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>If I remember correctly, this was about writing about suicide. I had been in a fight
         for a very long time. And I was nearly constantly suicidal. And so writing this piece
         was an engaging... It was obviously triggering.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was literally
         just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
         as
         South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
         Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But when I was making the
         actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
         actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
         identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
         identify.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
         and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
         that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
         ideas from.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Just building that list kind of helps me know where and how
         I'm getting the material, and the assumptions that I've made throughout the fanfic.
         And, therefore, helps make it easier to kind of discuss it later, I think.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one of the
         primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't want to be like, "Ah, but I'm writing the version of this character that's
         a woman." I hate that. I know that that's permissible with the meta text but I don't
         want to be part of that.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I chose to make it Desi because I am Desi. and I wanted
         to experience it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I mean, I think the
         choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
         setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
         trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
         for it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
         be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>You never
         really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
         to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
         with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
         wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
         Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
         because obviously they wouldn't be having as
         much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
         considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
         day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
         from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
         versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
         wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
         identity. But there would definitely be some push
         back, but how would that change based on the setting?
         I made her a little bit more comfortable in
         her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
         shoulder for Jaime
         who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
         well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
         way and being very new, if you're very new into
         like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
         a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
         higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
         or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
         You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
         anything.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
         wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
         their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
         that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
         work through those emotions with me.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of write it as like a self-fulfilling
         fantasy as well as like how I would have pictured them actually going through
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was
         definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
         back and explore myself with fan
         fic if I needed to as well.</li>

         back, but how would that change based on the setting?
         I made her a little bit more comfortable in
         her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
         shoulder for Jaime
         who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
         well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>from the source material where I wanted to kind of
         explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
         because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
         as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
         actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
         how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
         how she had gotten to living with Jaime.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That's definitely
         something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
         of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
         would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
         more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
         me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
         anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
         all of that.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted
         to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
         in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
         that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Most Game of Thrones fanfic is incredibly hetero
         normative and it's a lot of university AU, high school AU and
         I'm like, "What about literally anything else?" I did a modern universe
         [inaudible 00:37:49] Please, literally anything
         else.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And I actually really liked a
         show called Xena: Warrior Princess. That was kind of my very first fandom. I really
         liked, see I can't even remember now, Ares and Gabrielle. I wrote a fanfiction
         about them that was set in modern times. That was my very first fan
         fic.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>X-Men comics. And I wrote a story, once
         again, set in modern times. I kind of do this a lot. I take characters out of their
         setting and transpose them into reality.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I like the modern setting. Modern setting seems to be the most
         common one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
         active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
         especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
         and
         putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>

   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world
         and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting,"
         instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with
         it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's
         also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that
         I really was not before.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
         about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
         those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and I
         couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing I
         was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of
         the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was
         more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll
         do alternate points of view."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't know if I thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought
         about it as a storytelling tool obviously that helps power [inaudible 00:17:00], not
         necessarily about the story if it makes sense. I wasn't telling you things that had
         happened in the past, to teach you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This
         is what's haunting the characters, this is what the characters can't escape from in
         a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you
         know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon
         compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant,"
         as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant
         sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense
         to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a
         story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine
         that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on
         what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now.
         That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories
         that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And to be fair, omega and alpha as being there in the far right column. I don't really
         understand ABO [alpha, beta, omega] as in general, so I can't talk. They're not as
         inherently sexual. They definitely struck me as relatively sexual, and that's not</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But a few years later when I was, I think,
         13, my friend introduced me to like crack Lord Of The Rings fiction.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
         person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
         universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it was football RPF
         (real person fic) fanfiction. Which was very interesting, because I think it was
         just after the 2018 World Cup.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
         view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
         you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
         of
         view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
         what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
         more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah. I mean, I really do
         feel like there aren't that many second person point of views that kind of allow you
         to immerse yourself into that person, or into that character.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
         was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
         think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
         prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
         I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
         I can sort of tailor it to that,"</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
         a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
         always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
         at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
         art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
         it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
         person's mind."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even in the modern drabbles, or the
         other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
         she can access that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, these big cartoons that are for kids are doing more
         for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
         kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
         much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust."</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But
         basically where you would participate with one fan writing a line, the next fan
         writing another line and so on and so forth. So that was the first time that I
         actually wrote anything fandom related.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And then there was a bit of a lull until my delving into the
         Indian forums. And there we would do the meta analysis and satirical writings and
         so
         on. </li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I completely forgot, there was a
         period where I would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because
         I
         don't do that anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment
         with writing and being critical of source materials and so on.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I started writing and initially my own fanfic, so self insert fan
         fic when I was like maybe about 10 years old.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
         guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
         to when I came out to them.
         I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
         of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
         having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
         leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
         little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I learned how much writing a one shot sounds good and all in
         practice, but then it ends up opening all these other doors of should I write more,
         should I write less. I don't know what I should be doing with this.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because it has to hurt
         if it's to heal.</li>

   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
         have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
         in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
         I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
         convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
         arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I wrote a piece called Addict's Alchemy, which was a piece about...in terms of
         servicing some of the same things we're talking about today. It's a piece about about
         trauma... And it [inaudible 00:05:20], that this isn't obviously. It's a piece about
         trauma and it's a piece about, what does it mean... Really they're both pieces about
         what it means to be disabled.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
         very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
         you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
         original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
         through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
         and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
         with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
         get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
         you.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was coming into my own politically, I was becoming my own political individual in
         a way I hadn't been before. Like I had politics, but this is around the time that
         I'm really radicalized, and just me engaging with those contexts.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world
         and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting,"
         instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with
         it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's
         also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that
         I really was not before.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First of all I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it,
         as a writer. I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's
         beneficial or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it
         now, but I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy.
         I know I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized,
         and I didn't say that obviously in the tags.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
         I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
         already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
         weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
         about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
         those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and I
         couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing I
         was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because
         I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But that was the biggest bit of feedback I got was this conversation, and it helped
         a little bit.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then the last one's a content warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see
         homophobia. I can't not publish a story about homophobia.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
         I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
         but it felt more like a nod than a full</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
         there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
         feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
         a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
         different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
         in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
         and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
         looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of
         the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was
         more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll
         do alternate points of view."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>but this is what I was doing with my life. I was on my way to running a queer resource
         center at a college, so I was doing the work of feeling the political implications
         of things in the world. And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about
         is to write about... Not just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia,
         not just homophobia, but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because
         this was the thing that was radicalizing me, [inaudible] is vile, because... And it
         was about violence, so I don't just mean violence as a method of resistance, I mean
         violence as a thing that people survive. Because that's what's radicalizing me at
         the time. And so I felt the need to wake up that in a sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't know if I thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought
         about it as a storytelling tool obviously that helps power [inaudible 00:17:00], not
         necessarily about the story if it makes sense. I wasn't telling you things that had
         happened in the past, to teach you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This
         is what's haunting the characters, this is what the characters can't escape from in
         a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you
         know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It was a piece that was sufficiently about me that it would have been fun and helpful
         for a lot of people. But this, I think it was a good piece, it was a piece that was
         a whole other world to read</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political
         institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family
         institutions. My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community
         college is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of
         people that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't
         talk about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
         that was the only source of information.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was trying to write a story that engaged with trauma and felt authentic and didn't
         make trauma seem like the end of the world. Because the binary that's in a lot of
         literature is either like, "Oh, you either overcame trauma, or you are doomed to misery
         forever." And I was trying to find some middle ground, trying to tell a story that
         felt authentic.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
         her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
         Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
         is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
         dress herself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to tell a story about connection. And I wanted to make it clear that when
         I'm telling the story, I think that even [inaudible 00:26:39] understands that it's
         not really about romance as much as it is about feeling connected in a genuine way
         to people, that that central theme, building a life worth living after injury, or
         after trauma, is finding an authentic realtionship with people.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And so Asami plays that role, being a person to whom Korra wants to relate, is thrilled
         to relate, is not scared, or she is a little bit scared to relate, but is she scared
         to relate in the way that she's scared to relate to other people.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
         progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
         man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
         and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
         said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
         understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
         woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
         This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
         institution itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>In the context of this piece, a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois
         radical is that I'm not going to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really
         have a sense of class politics at the time, or have the beginnings of that study.
         That's only beginning to be born</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to give a sense of what is the politics of the Northern Water Tribe? And
         I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water Tribe,
         or is not criminalized anymore. Also I wanted to say this is a different relationship.
         But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give
         up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>He's not particularly flawed, because he's willing to play this opportunistic political
         game. Because he's also capable of looking at his child and going, "Maybe I shouldn't
         do that." </li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I would also say a little bit about some of the research I'd read at the time, turns
         out the book I was reading at the time that claimed that knowing someone who was gay
         had a significant...Or not knowing someone who was gay, but engaging with someone
         who's gay on the topic of being gay helped significantly with changing someone's political
         views, or being willing to accept gay people. Turns out that one was actually wrong,
         like literally the person who put together that study cooked the book.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I also sort of wanted to talk... I sort of was thinking about the limits of the political
         and the [inaudible 00:35:57] of the political. You could do what, when and where,
         the idea that a politician can't really save the world. I don't know if I was all
         the way to, "We have to do it," yet, but I think I'm getting there.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was thinking about New York City around the times of the Stonewall Riots. This is
         where those politics come in. I was playing with, what does it mean... I was playing
         with, what's particularly violent political oppression? What are the limits of political
         oppression in a relatively liberal cosmopolitan society? Because I was getting that
         sense of, there's actually a whole lot of ways that political oppression can happen
         that I'd never even thought about at this point, and I was learning about that. So
         I was writing about this character as someone who's experiencing the limits of that
         political oppression. And this is actually one of the key storylines in my opinion,
         and it's ultimately a story about resistance to a kind of political oppression</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This was written obviously before Donald Trump becomes President, and I could see
         all sorts of things about reaction again. But I was seeing the reaction, I was scared.
         I don't know where I got this, there was something bad was coming. I knew that I had
         that sense of fear, so I was writing about... I guess writing a little bit about,
         how do we fight back when things get worse?</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I also learned that you have to be careful with how much to take on, and you have
         to be careful about what you're willing to prune, and you have to be ready to prune
         things. And you have to be ready to follow a story where it goes instead of trying
         to follow all the directions you ever imagined. Because if you try to follow a story
         in every direction you have, then it's going to die like this piece did. It's like,
         "I don't know how to integrate the story into itself anymore."</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I had a very close group of friends on Live Journal back
         in the early 2000s. That, I think, probably because I was a teenager. Perhaps this
         is because of all those reasons. But that kind of close-knittedness has never kind
         of shown up for me ever since. I think I tend to participate now on more, "Oh, this
         is really interesting for me. And this is really fascinating." And I'll go into it
         for the material as opposed to the friendships themselves.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Mostly to keep
         myself writing. Because, otherwise, I would just not publish those materials until
         it becomes, you know. It's basically sitting on my hard drive for years and years
         on
         end, and finally I get the opportunity and the motivation to publish them.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because,
         initially, it was definitely a very close-knit, just writing for friends and with
         friends.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I've also recently published work in Fleabag, which
         was one of the fandoms that I had to write for for my Yuletide assignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>There's a couple of things that you see that are kind of
         interesting, and then you kind of identify a certain actor, or a certain character
         that you kind of find interesting. And then jump from there to another.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yes. I think my most recent published fanfiction is a
         Percy Weasley, second person point of view, post canon. In which he is attempting
         to
         basically restructure his society by running on a platform of big structural change.
         Which might sound vaguely familiar.  But it was, I
         think, mostly due to the kind of deep rage that I was feeling over the entire
         Democratic Primaries over the past couple of months. And almost the past year.
         In which everything felt very much like a lot of talk, and not a lot of doing.
         And at some point, you need some catharsis. And kind of putting it out into
         fiction and seeing something changing. Or, not even seeing something changing.
         But seeing people trying to effect change, and willing to fight for that change
         felt very important to me. And basically that entire fanfic is kind of born out
         of that seething, massive, "I want to see something happening."
         And I will see it happen in fiction, if not in reality.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>was talking about that, and I felt like
         that was a really fascinating look into that psyche. And seeing how Fleabag and the
         Priest would meet up. And how they would be after having separated for 20, 30 years,
         coming back to see each other after they have had full lives apart, but somehow
         still wanting something more. Which, I think, it's definitely, kind of, for me, I
         am
         not old enough to be discussing 50 year old, 60 year old life plans. But my life
         path has never been very straight, or what I felt that it would be. Because when I
         was, what? 15, I probably thought I'd be an engineer. And then after that I thought
         I'd be a doctor. And then, suddenly, now I'm a lawyer. And I thought I'd be in the
         U.S., and I'm in India. And it's a very wildly divergent and strange life path for
         me. And that's only been over, what? 10 years, 10, 15 years. And I can't even
         imagine how that would be over 20, 30 years. And identifying that desire for home,
         and wanting people to be that. As opposed to a given area, or a given job, or
         anything like that, felt very poignant to me at that particular point in
         time.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one fic that I was relatively and very
         proud of. To be honest.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
         the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
         Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
         film."</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
         person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
         universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And if you're just starting from scratch, then it's
         difficult to create why two people would hate each other so much. I mean, you need
         to have that religious, and
         cultural, and those barriers in order for that to
         happen.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I mean, I think the
         choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
         setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
         trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
         for it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
         view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
         you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
         of
         view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
         what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
         more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And that also came across to a lot of readers, is what
         they were telling me, at least. Because they felt like there was a lot more gravitas
         to the entire fic that you wouldn't see in a lot of my other
         fanfics.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that for
         the actual research it was not so much that I did it for this particular fanfic, as
         it was more that I love that era a lot. So, I had tended to research it before, as
         well. So, I had a lot of information that I kind of knew in colloquial terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I did
         not remember the exact way that he had died, so then I kind of went searching for
         that. And then, I mean, from there it kind of spiraled into researching other things
         and kind of reading up more about Akbar and more about Jodhaa. And I'm an avid
         research. I mean, that's what I do now.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Where I
         just didn't translate them into Rajput or Hindi words. Because I just use
         whatever I knew, because I speak Kannada at home. And that's
         another language entirely. And I was just running out of time, and I said, "You know
         what? No, I'll just handle it myself. And not translate it, and hope that nobody
         minds.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think a lot of the research and a lot of the material
         was just about identifying and pulling disparate ideas together that I knew.
         From either my own culture because, of course,
         this is partially my own culture. And also, the historical
         details of [inaudible 00:27:49].</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think that was what
         was very important to me, especially in this story, was puling it all together so
         that there weren't any open endings. And the research really, somehow, it helped in
         pulling that together.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I honestly expected nobody to do
         that. It's good to see that people are just as interested in a lot of it, in this
         stuff. You know?</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that the
         thing I wanted to keep in mind was that I was doing the research, but I was also not
         putting as much research into it as I probably should have if I wanted to make it
         historical fiction.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was literally
         just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
         as
         South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
         Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And that was one thing I wanted to be clear about.
         Because, yes, it was research. But I think I wanted to keep to the spirit of the
         movie, as well as the spirit of the A Song of Ice and Fire canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But when I was making the
         actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
         actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
         identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
         identify.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
         and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
         that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
         ideas from.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was really worried about how it
         would be perceived by the fandom, how it would be received by people even outside
         of
         the fandom.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one of the
         primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
         sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was
         really worried about it, actually. Because I spoke to a couple people before I
         published the fanfic. Because I was kind of worried about it, and I wasn't sure how
         it would be received.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I wasn't sure people would
         think that it was good enough. Because I was also combining both South Indian and
         North Indian tropes, to a
         certain extent. And those weren't necessarily very compatible. And there's a lot
         of history behind that and everything. And I wasn't entirely
         sure how people would perceive it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But people were very kind about it. And I haven't
         actually gotten a single negative feedback on that fanfic to date.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And
         especially when she has that fight with Jon and she goes back home. And that was,
         I
         think, the point of catharsis. Because especially when you're looking at a lot of
         Indian mothers, and Indian
         women who get into marriages at a very young age. You have to deal with your
         husband's family, you have to deal with that entire kind of stigma. About you
         have to be the one to adjust and to compromise to a far greater extent than your
         husband. And all of these kind of had come together and had
         been marinating for a very long time. And I feel like Sansa, in this, was very much
         the product of that. Where she was
         just trying to fight it, she was such a perfect child in that culture. And then
         suddenly she has to kind of leave her culture behind. Or, not leave her culture
         behind, but adjust to a new culture. And she feels like she's
         being punished by her old one for no fault of her own. And all of it, kind of, her
         desperate unhappiness, her tensions with her mother were a big part of the fic, I
         think, for me.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong> And I was so
         worried. Because all of this was very close to my heart, and I did not want to have
         to deal with a lot of backlash, or feedback, or having to fight to say, "Well, I
         don't mean to be rude on any of these kinds of things." These are meant with respect
         and they're meant with love. And they're from a part of myself.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, with all of that in mind, the actual fandom
         response was absolutely wonderful, and absolutely, completely respectful. And none
         of my fears at all came to fruition.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because they were all so kind, and so respectful of the entire fic in
         general.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because that's what I keep feeling whenever I look back at
         it, was how I got almost consumed by the characters when I was writing them.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I
         didn't feel like I could end it with, "Oh, everybody has kids and they're all
         happy." Because that felt very weird, and kind of disjointed with the rest of the
         fic.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And
         in that Sansa can see ghosts. And throughout the entire fic, it's a long fic and
         everything, but one of the biggest issues for me was, how do I end this?</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But to me, it felt like it began with Jon and
         it had to end with Jon. And it had to end with him finally being triumphant, and
         finally being happy for his triumph at the end of this fanfic.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
         clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
         Jon is raised a Targaryen.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
         because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
         other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
         fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
         particular tag.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But then the cultural tensions stem almost entirely
         from the differences within their upbringing, I'm pretty sure. Within their
         families. And I mean, there are
         cultural differences within, I mean, people that I've grown up with in India,
         and people in the U.S. And even though you're living side by side, that doesn't
         necessarily mean that you have the same cultural background.
         And I think that's something that both of them don't understand. And both of them
         kind of try to understand slowly.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And if you're talking about other moments,
         like when Sansa wants to give Jon his name, and he asks her to read it out loud. I
         think that's another moment of compromise. Because as much as she's giving him the
         gift,
         she's also giving him his name. And she's stepping across her own cultural
         boundaries to help him with that, which Jon doesn't completely
         understand.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Especially the quote that you put up here,
         which refers to Sansa's eyes. Because that was a moment for me, I think, more than
         anything else.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
         that was something that even when you agree to a marriage, and even when you kind
         of
         accept that. Especially when you go into your husband's house, and if you're living
         with his parents and everything. It's a very difficult concept. And it's a very
         difficult idea. And adjusting to that
         is a huge, almost, culture shock to people.
         To any women, adjusting to that is
         difficult. No matter who it is, no matter where you're going.
         So, then, I mean, especially for Sansa, who needs to leave behind her entire family.
         And doesn't even know when she'll be able to go back. And has to go to a foreign country
         without any
         support, and any of her own traditions. She's the one that's upheld every single
         tradition she has ever done. And especially when you're looking at the Hindu
         culture, it's very difficult to uphold them.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, finally, she
         slowly starts to grow into that. She starts to give moments of peace. You know,
         she's kind of giving Jon gifts, and she's trying to bridge that gap. Because she
         also realizes that it's her life, too. Which, I think, is one of the biggest
         realizations that a lot of women have. Which is, "Yes, I'm miserable. I want you to
         be miserable. But how am I going
         to be miserable for?" You need to let some things go, you need to move on past
         the injustices... I need to move past the injustices that I have
         faced.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>The one quote that you picked out here, "You stand before your father, bedecked in
         gossamer and lace and silk, glass thick and shining in your hair." Because that was
         one that I actually remember. Because I initially put the word jewel, and jewels in
         the place of the word glass. But then I wanted it, for her, to feel that it was
         cheaper than the jewel. Even if she had them, they didn't matter to her. Because it
         was just glass.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>As if, her family... Or, she's feeling as if her family is not willing to give
         her as much as she is owed when she's going into a
         marriage.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Oh. I think I learned that people are far more
         understanding than I was giving them credit for, especially because I was so afraid
         about the reception.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But then, I also think that one of the major
         things that I learned was probably that some of the anger, it doesn't have to be a
         very you anger to be a very deep one. For it to seep into your writing. Because a
         lot of the time, especially when I'm writing angry stories and everything, they tend
         to be immediate. Like, "Okay, I'm very angry right now. And I want to have a fit.
         And I want to do it." But this was something that it had kind have been, I think,
         brewing for a very long time. And then suddenly the anger, and the angst, and the
         hurt, and the pain, all kind of came out. But at the same time, it was not just
         that. It was also about passing through that anger, and knowing that there is going
         to be someone at the end of it who's willing to accept you.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I hate that I did it, but I did real-person
         fanfiction for Paramore. Thinking of it now, it's always like, "God, that's not
         good. I shouldn't have done it, but here we are."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
         very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
         queer
         characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
         go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
         their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
         situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I'm
         trying to write something that's original, and that's always a bit more of an
         endeavor than you expect it to be.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, it was definitely, when I first started it, it
         was, "Okay, well, I kind of just want to write, and I want to get better at writing,
         practicing it." I started it in college, and the professor I had at that time kept
         saying how, "If you want to get better at writing, you have to write 50,000 words,
         and then, you have to write another 50,000." "Really? All right. I'll just write,
         then. People will give me prompts and I'll just write those as they come in." And
         then, there were a lot of prompts that came in, surprisingly. I was able to stay
         consistent with it for, I want to say, two, three years.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's funny, going back to the original ones, the
         older ones at least, and reading those, because you sent me one. I think it was
         chapter 37 you mentioned in your email, and I went back and read it and I was like,
         "Oof, I could do this a lot better now, I hope."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. Just, I wanted to get better at it, and people
         were really good at giving me things that I could easily do at work,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I didn't necessarily want to
         do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to
         a
         point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
         each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
         all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
         can't."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a couple that, I don't
         remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
         [inaudible 00:09:21] on purpose, so that it had to be
         like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
         was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
         think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
         prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
         I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
         I can sort of tailor it to that,"</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
         a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
         always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
         at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
         art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
         it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
         person's mind."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I like that a lot of people, I still get comments
         occasionally that are, "I've just gone through this whole thing," and you can do
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I also like that you can sort of see a progression of
         how I wrote them and how my own skills have maybe, hopefully developed. And even
         just, it did end up being four years' worth of time</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
         been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
         And maybe, I think,
         during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
         different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
         strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, if there were some things where I'd write the
         original drabble, and then I might get three more immediate requests in my inbox for
         a sequel, or for, "Can I get a full length thing of this?" And I didn't necessarily
         have the time or energy, or just the inclination in some cases.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I would start to feel guilty, and sometimes
         would just push one out whether or not I felt it was up to par, even though I hoped
         it was.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I mean, most
         of it was positive, which was really good. If somebody really didn't like something,
         they didn't usually tell me. Or if they did, sometimes it was like a spelling error
         or a formatting error, and it'd be, "Okay, I can just easily fix that." I don't
         think there were too many outright negative things. There was one. I don't think it
         was on a prompt, but this artist I really liked at the time commented and said
         something like, "This would've been better with this movie instead of the one you
         actually used," and didn't necessarily anything positive otherwise. I don't know if
         they actually liked it, or if it was just sort of a, "Well, I would've liked it
         better if you'd done this thing the way I wanted you to." Which, it is what it is,
         and you sort of have to just say, "Okay, well, this is the way I did it, and I'm not
         going to change it." But it was definitely a situation where I was like, "Okay.
         Don't know what to make of that."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Most of the time, people are very, very happy about
         it, because it was just another thing for them to read.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I'm
         very much a person who believes in, if you can't say it in like two words
         then you probably shouldn't. So, I like to have it, what
         is this thing? And that's it. I like to be able to say, "This is what it's going to
         be," and it doesn't necessarily need to be more complicated than that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
         get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
         distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
         be
         able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
         somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
         something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
         looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
         and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
         is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
         different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
         know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
         way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
         So, I tried to mix it up on occasion.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And
         okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
         notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
         figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
         she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
         Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
         things stand out immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Things like that, you notice immediately, but also that
         it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
         I
         don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
         trying to get portrayed.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
         only get a certain amount of them in canon.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
         it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
         since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
         until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
         a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
         decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
         this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
         case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
         Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
         bit.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, for that chapter, I want to say, like everything
         else in the collection, it was a prompt, but it was something that I didn't want to
         ham-fist it, because Korra's definitely, she's
         traumatized. We see that more than once,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> So, in this one in particular, she's trying to have a good experience and maybe power
         through it, but then, in that brief lapse where she forgets that she's tied down
         and then she tries to sit up, it's sort of like a muscle memory thing, where
         she's back there the last time she was chained up and couldn't
         move. But also, at the same time, I wanted Asami to immediately
         be there and to be immediately helpful and not push her. She was just trying to be
         comforting. You hear stories about how people
         try and be helpful and just make situations worse, but at this
         point in their relationship, Korra and Asami knew each other super well, and even
         though this is an unusual situation for them, Asami knows how Korra reacts and knows
         who she is and what she's thinking. She's able to help her come back slowly, rather
         than try and make it a quick thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I think I'd notice, not spacing errors, pacing
         errors in that, I could've slowed that down a bit, I could've drawn the reader in
         a
         little bit more, just things like that, where it's just like, "I maybe know how to
         write now," so it hopefully could've made it a little bit more
         engaging.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, again, it was the prompts, but it was
         also, I have personally been a little conflicted on gender for a while, and it's
         like my sexuality, it was something that I sort of just say, "Well, I'll get to
         that when I have the chance." So, it's always just sort of in
         the back of my head</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I
         try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
         to live with a person she loves, doing
         something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
         complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
         obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
         yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
         be happy.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
         that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
         most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
         see what they're going through and you see how their lives are,
         and I try not to speak for situations that I've never lived through, but you can
         draw knowledge from that and say, "Okay, well, without going in depth into feelings
         or things like that, I can add this, this, and this, and make it maybe relatable in
         that regard."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
         serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
         just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
         things that made me super uncomfortable.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's also, given the
         audience, this is considered a family show. So, I realized over time that maybe I
         don't have to write that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
         it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
         press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
         slaves is super ... I didn't want to
         contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
         [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
         more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
         been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
         thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
         though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
         for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>It was
         partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
         Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I wanted it to, like everything
         else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
         to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And I also wanted to give the collection itself a
         sendoff I was proud of. So, I spent a little bit more time on that than I did a lot
         of the other stuff, just let it marinate. "You know what? This is a good end, and
         hope you enjoyed," sort of thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So now,
         I sort of write when I want to, when I have the motivation. And if I'm feeling it,
         yeah, I'll do a little bit. Like somebody requested a prompt two weeks ago. I was
         like, "You know what? Why not. I'm feeling it. We're going to go for it."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I learned to just not push it,
         don't write what other people are demanding, necessarily.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>My audience should be myself, at the end of the day. I
         want to write the things that I want to read. Even if I'd much rather prefer just
         reading it and not having to put the time and effort into clacking my way through
         it, if I want to read it, I have to write it sometimes, which is fine. But I should
         enjoy the things that I'm writing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's okay that maybe only three other people
         also liked it, but I like it.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think I started writing
         fan fiction in earnest because I was homesick. Because I had recently moved, and so
         it was with the intent of writing something that was close to home but also part of
         fandom that I started doing that.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I
         think with Twilight it was just that phase where you finally find a
         story that speaks to you, even if you kind of hate it when you look back at it when
         you're older. But at the time, how
         Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
         small community and so forth and deals with depression or
         whatever it is, it just seemed to be something that I could relate to. And so
         I was both interested in that, and I guess in the power fantasy that she was written
         to
         come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
         characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
         was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
         happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background
         and
         the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
         that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
         Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
         I
         could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
         been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
         how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I kind of wanted to see that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular,
         and this was surprising for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I
         never really remember to think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like
         there was this big gap available to us for exploration.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So I kind of wanted to explore that and see how
         Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for me I like to see how the characters
         are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to
         them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>For
         this particular fic, I think it was just the imagery. I was really trying to grasp
         something that in some ways is so intangible. I was trying so hard to get just that
         feeling of desolation and aching.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But the metaphor itself of the Marching Ants, it was
         this way of articulating the anxiety that comes along with that.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I think it
         just came back to capturing that, the imagery of it, the tone of the chapter, the
         voice of it because, at least to me, it works really hard to put us in Asami's shoes
         and make us experience it exactly as she's experiencing it.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
         And in terms of relationships and love and so forth, it was I guess just coming back
         to what I like to explore in fiction, which is how people are interacting with each
         other, what it means for them. And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
         not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
         audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
         exploration. So I like to see for myself how their worth is existing within these
         relationships, what it means for them and what it can mean for the audience and so
         forth.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess the sensation of ants ... I come from an area
         where you commonly come into contact with animals and so on, so I'm familiar with
         the actual physical reality of ants crawling across your skin, and there's a way
         that it feels. It's like a sort of weird, prickling sensation that is very
         disconcerting, and I guess I wanted to translate that into how the story reflects
         Asami's own experience with whatever she's feeling. And that imagery just seemed to
         click with that, just the experience of having something under your skin and on your
         skin, even if you can't quite articulate what it is.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
         came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
         that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Whereas, for
         Asami, Asami didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have
         anyone. So she went back to someone, I
         guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
         for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
         act of violence ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore
         that. It's just fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow
         still find a way to circle back around to the people who have hurt
         them.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
         think I was both going for an understanding of how Asami herself is effected by this
         really terrible thing we see happen to Korra.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's just to be someone who builds and creates
         with the purpose of fixing or making better, but then not being able to do so for
         someone within your personal life. But the imagery also for that chapter was, I guess,
         built in subtext because I wasn't
         quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
         to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
         community.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> It has less to do with fandom
         itself and more to do with the external world. And even now it's, I guess it's ...
         I
         don't know. I think it
         just seemed like the safer option at the time.  But the more
         time I've spent in that part of fandom, the less I guess I've cared about how it's
         read or whatever it is. But at the time, it just seemed wiser, particularly if I was
         having others who may not ... Because fan works and original work for me are on the
         same level, and so I'm not concerned, I guess, with people reading it for ... people
         reading it and not seeing a difference in quality, but rather how they experience
         the content. And so I think I was still considering who the audience would
         be.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So both as a black person and as a woman, it was
         just important for me to recognize that in text and get around to exploring what
         that might have meant for other characters who weren't within the Circle of the
         Avatar and had powerful connections.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because there is this thing in fanfiction where we
         assume that all people who are accessing it are familiar with the text. And while
         that is often common when we want it to function beyond that world to have relevance
         in other ways, I think for me personally it's important to integrate more parts of
         the world, of the universe.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>For me, it was just reminding myself that, even though I'm
         writing something where there are people who are familiar with the text, it's also
         important to fill in the blanks sometimes.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Of course, being
         younger, you don't really understand romance all
         typically well. It's all very idealized. Then as I got older, I
         started liking to delve more into different types of friendships as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
         to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
         bi-sexual. I used it sort of as a tool in some fanfics to work
         through ideas or feelings that I'd had and didn't know how to properly verbalize
         yet. I was putting them on paper, using another
         character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
         where I felt I was kind of safe to do so. I didn't always
         publish all of them, but the one that you contacted me over, I did,
         obviously.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I wrote it in
         one sitting in a Starbucks near my university.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was around the
         time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary and
         I tried to sort of work things out with Jaime as the main focal character</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
         Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
         because obviously they wouldn't be having as
         much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
         considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
         day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
         from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
         versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
         wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
         identity. But there would definitely be some push
         back, but how would that change based on the setting?
         I made her a little bit more comfortable in
         her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
         shoulder for Jaime
         who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
         well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>writing it also based off
         of my own experiences, just exploring the LGBT
         community in my area, I was kind of writing it from that
         perspective, but also not having as much information as I would like. </li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That, and also trying to write
         and finish an entire fanfic in one sitting is very difficult when it's in a public
         setting. Luckily, it happened and it was a nice exercise as well, just also to be
         able to sit and write and have it really done in one sitting and then put it out
         there was very satisfying.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I did a very brief
         look over and then I was like, "Screw it,"</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I got a very
         interesting response from someone. I believe, maybe a week or two after. They were
         like, "It's a really well written fanfic, it's great, but why in God's (capital G)
         name, did you make Jaime like this?" And the moment I saw capital G, I was like I
         see. I tried to be as cordial as I could and I explained what I said earlier about
         my inspiration</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, that was the one big kick
         back I got from someone. I was a little bit shocked that I got the capital G person,
         but what can you do?</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>While I do ship them together romantically, I
         wanted to write something that also reflected that you could do like a very intimate
         moment without bring sex into it as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It's
         something that I wanted to, again, wanted to bring into a fanfic to kind of make it
         more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and
         wondering the same thing.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
         them being intimate, but it was all
         very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
         vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
         I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
         own instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I guess I wanted to
         get a very powerful moment on paper. I had all these ideas and notes about what was
         also going on in the universe and what not, but this was the one that kind of
         started it. I wanted to make sure that I could get it down and not have it be that
         fanfic that I write in my head and then I just cannot put on paper later on.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I really wanted
         to address the gender issue and the gender questioning and write how the
         experiences hit the hardest for me when I was thinking about
         it. Definitely.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think he definitely
         is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
         means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
         way and being very new, if you're very new into
         like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
         a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
         higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
         or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
         You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
         anything.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, so at the
         same time I was writing this fanfic, I was writing another one that kind of delved
         into the timeline of how Jaime grew up.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It went
         into his relationship with his father, he was caught walking in his mother's red
         heels and he got very scolded and punished for it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>This is a topic
         that I was a little bit hesitant to tackle because at the time, when I was writing,
         I wasn't very well-versed in
         not just having a limb missing as a disability, but also how advanced the
         prosthetics were and if they could hold things. I did a little
         bit of research while I was at Starbucks, trying to sort of complete
         everything.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>If I were to do this fic over again or
         update it or add on to it, I would definitely
         want to go more into his disability as well as his prosthetic and how it worked
         more. Things like that to sort of flush it out more because I
         don't think in the fic I didn't do the best job I could at it. It was sort of
         something I tried to fill out as much as I could in the fic, but I probably could
         have done better.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
         wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
         their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
         that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
         work through those emotions with me.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>The first big one
         is never write an entire fanfic in Starbucks.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was
         definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
         back and explore myself with fan
         fic if I needed to as well.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then that's when I kind of got feedback, because the
         first fanfic, I never got any feedback from anyone. I was just like, "Oh, I'm
         shouting into the dark." So yeah, it kind of changed, and it got me a bit more
         active, and like, people actually want to say something about it. What did you think
         about it? I started getting a bit more communication, a bit more activity.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And someone wrote a really detailed review, just about
         how, I remember they said they could taste the road dust from my writing. And I was
         like, wow. I never thought of it that way. That's really cool. That kind of inspired
         me to write more, that I could get that emotion out of somebody. They felt like they
         were actually there with them.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
         Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
         Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
         no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
         brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
         thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
         wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
         series, the first one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
         know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
         And
         it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
         What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
         And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
         and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
         the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
         that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
         world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
         would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
         maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
         how I got into that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because I'm
         a length whore. That's the problem. I get into these fics, and I have these ideas,
         and then they expand out of control, and then I get into a story that's suddenly 30
         chapters long, and then I run out of steam. I'm one of those authors who does kind
         of get bored, and then starts cheating on my fic, which is happening right now in
         Game of Thrones.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
         written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
         okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
         alone.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's not done. It's not a solid 200 pages. I'm a very
         chaotic writer, so I will get a bit of dialog in my head. I will see something, and
         I will kind of write around that, and build around that, and string a bunch of
         scenes. It's 200 pages, but it's 200 pages of broken up paragraphs, bits of dialog,
         bits of scenery. So if I ever fleshed it out, it would be much longer, because I
         have a problem containing myself.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I've had a
         couple requests from the other ones. They're like, "I would love to read this
         story." I'm like, "No, you don't understand. It's a lot to wade
         through."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
         I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
         outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
         really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
         to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a very hard time
         getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
         motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
         are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
         that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
         top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
         think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
         little bit of character assassination.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted to kind of show a Sansa who was still herself.
         A Sansa who was willing to not listen to him, who
         understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
         manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
         only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
         run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
         ends are." That's kind of where that idea came from.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She was
         supposed to kind of get lost in the trees, and they were supposed to find her. But
         I
         thought that was a little bit ignominious for her. So then I remembered, Oh,
         Nimeria's wolf pack. I was like, they haven't used that in the show at all, so why
         not?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's actually a lot more of that fic that is written
         that didn't make it in. A whole thing where you get it from Nimeria's point of view
         where you can see her. She's like, okay, just following to see what's going to
         happen. And then when Sansa decides to run, that's when she decides to attack. But
         I
         thought that was a bit superfluous, so I took all of that out.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
         of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
         That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
         delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
         Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
         away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
         one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
         fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
         of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
         if I was a former slave. The one thing I
         would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
         in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
         into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
         anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
         like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
         underused character.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
         thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
         in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
         and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
         unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
         me
         try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
         There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
         improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
         "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
         People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
         right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
         The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
         right.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Ratings may change, warnings may change, series,
         spoilers, all those kind of speak for themselves, just to let you know that okay,
         once again, this isn't static. This is something that changes story by story. Some
         of them may be Gen, some of them, I haven't written one yet, but some of them may
         be
         adult in the future. Some of them may have a lot of violence in them, so just be
         aware. Don't ever come back to this fic and think, "This is what it is." Because
         that's not it.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
         never know. I think my
         characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
         "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
         it may be out of character."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a lot of Game of Thrones stuff on the cutting
         room floor, before I decided what to actually post. And there is about 20 other
         drabbles for the one series that haven't made it yet, because I'm one of those
         writers.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I adore the Dorne
         storyline in the books, and they completely butchered it in the show. So, that's why
         I
         was like, no Dorne's way smarter than this. So yes, he's going to be the Dorne that
         you
         get in the books.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
         divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
         want to get blasted on that one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
         dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
         that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
         Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
         beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
         thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's a poem that I really like. I can't remember the name of it now,
         but it talks about moonlight, and how in moonlight, everything is very stark, and
         it's
         clearer for all that starkness. She's seeing everything for who he is.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Sansa is really presented as one of those girls with her
         head in the clouds. She's definitely not a Margaery Tyrell. She was definitely never
         really prepared for court
         life. She has a view of it that is heavily skewed by stories of
         [inaudible 00:33:28] of these wonderful knights in their shining armor, these
         lovely ladies who are just ethereal in their beauty, everything being wrapped up
         in a bow, happily ever after. Maybe something happens, but someone's always
         rescued. And through the series, that kind of gets torn away
         from her bit by bit. The Prince Charming that she thought was a Prince Charming is
         definitely not. There's no one comes to save her. Her brother's more interested in
         being a king than coming to rescue her from the tower, and the monsters inside it.
         So really, Sansa's really forced to grow up,
         and she's really forced to see all these stories as exactly what they are.
         They're just stories. They're empty stories to make children
         happy. So when she's thinking back on this, she's thinking more of the scarier
         stories that maybe she didn't want to listen to.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>What I was afraid of, I should never have
         been afraid of, what I wanted was the thing I should have been worried about.
         She's really kind of flipped the script in her own mind. And
         she's standing amongst these wolves, and it's like before, she would have been
         terrified. She would have been cowering. And now she realizes, this is where I need
         to be. This is where it's at.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
         Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
         without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
         something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
         times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
         I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
         to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
         think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
         sentiment.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
         seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
         woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
         anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
         back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
         Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
         slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
         she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
         jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
         great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
         I've seen it before.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's a smile of, I
         can't think of the word, but being resigned to my fate. And if this is it, then this
         is it. And like I say, she recognizes in Cersei the same evil that she saw in
         Astapor where she's kind of like, "No, you
         would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
         think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
         better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
         are not. You are exactly like them." And in the end, she kind
         of wants to let her know. It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
         that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me. I see exactly what
         you are.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Like I
         said, as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
         be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
         be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself. Kind of like, I hate to use the
         comparison, but if you ever get out of a really bad relationship, and you're just
         like, "No, never again. I know the signs. I will never let that happen to me again."
         And for her of course it's more extreme,
         from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
         decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
         getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
         found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
         myself.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But there are people who
         they're really willing to engage with you, and they have questions. In a lot of
         other fandoms, some people are just like, "This is a nice story." Game of Thrones
         fans will have questions for you in the comments. They'll be like, "What about this?
         And what about this? Oh, what about this? What do you think about this?" It's fun
         to
         get that dialog. That's something I never had before.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>In one of my other fics, there's the Deviant Lord. We
         will run out of the character requirement, talking to each other back and forth in
         comments about things.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I learned a little bit, I actually had to do a bit of
         research on some of the fic, for things like trauma, and how people respond to
         trauma. Especially in the case of Sansa and Missandei, how do people overcome
         certain difficulties after being in these different positions? That was a little bit
         interesting. I did a little bit of in-depth on that, because once again, I'm that
         nerd.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually
         had one troll who just wrote, "Fuck you, you bastard." And I was like, yes. I was
         just like, "Whoa. Okay. I'm sorry you're having such a bad day. Go have a mimosa.
         Just don't take it out on me."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But
         there are just people who are just nasty. In all the fandoms I've been in, it
         thankfully hasn't happened to me yet, and I've actually had people defend me in
         comments. They're just like, "Get that shit out of here." I'm like, "Okay, thank you
         for being nice." But it seems the Game of Thrones fandoms can get real violent. They
         get real virulent with their hatred in the comments section. I can't muster that
         kind of hatred. If I don't like something, I just click off of it. I don't get the
         hate.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, mostly
         it was Googling, recovering from trauma. I did a little bit of research on former
         slaves, to see their mindset. That was a little bit what I did use for the mindset
         of Missandei. Because people who've been in that situation, they go through, what
         is
         it called? No, goodness, I can't remember. But it was a very good article, and it
         was talking about how former slaves, they go through this process of not believing
         that they're free, and not believing that they're free, and not believing that
         they're free. And eventually, they get to a
         point where it sticks in their head, that this is freedom. This is what they
         have. No one can control them. And then, they get very, very almost violently
         independent, where no one's going to tell me what to do. You can't tell me what
         to do. No one's going to do that to me. Once again, how some
         people where to a much lesser extent, when you get out of controlling, overbearing
         relationships, and then you're finally free, and you're like, "Fuck that shit. Where
         am I going? I'm staying out all night. And I don't have to tell anybody."
         They get this burst of a sense of self, a
         sense of purpose. And I thought that was very beautiful, that there are people
         who can go through all that type of trauma, and they can get there, and they can
         fully bloom. And I always saw Missandei as kind of that character, this
         character who had gone through all of that to the point where here she is,
         standing tall as a character that knows her own worth, knows her own
         personage.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then with Sansa, just how people recover
         from abusive and traumatic relationships, and things like that. The stages of
         recovery.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
         the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
         so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
         Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
         and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I wrote a piece called Addict's Alchemy, which was a piece about...in terms of
         servicing some of the same things we're talking about today. It's a piece about about
         trauma... And it [inaudible 00:05:20], that this isn't obviously. It's a piece about
         trauma and it's a piece about, what does it mean... Really they're both pieces about
         what it means to be disabled.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world
         and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting,"
         instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with
         it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's
         also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that
         I really was not before.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First of all I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it,
         as a writer. I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's
         beneficial or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it
         now, but I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy.
         I know I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized,
         and I didn't say that obviously in the tags.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
         about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
         those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and I
         couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing I
         was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of
         the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was
         more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll
         do alternate points of view."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't know if I thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought
         about it as a storytelling tool obviously that helps power [inaudible 00:17:00], not
         necessarily about the story if it makes sense. I wasn't telling you things that had
         happened in the past, to teach you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This
         is what's haunting the characters, this is what the characters can't escape from in
         a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you
         know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
         her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
         Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
         is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
         dress herself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And so Asami plays that role, being a person to whom Korra wants to relate, is thrilled
         to relate, is not scared, or she is a little bit scared to relate, but is she scared
         to relate in the way that she's scared to relate to other people.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
         progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
         man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
         and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
         said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
         understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
         woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
         This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
         institution itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>He's not particularly flawed, because he's willing to play this opportunistic political
         game. Because he's also capable of looking at his child and going, "Maybe I shouldn't
         do that." </li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I also sort of wanted to talk... I sort of was thinking about the limits of the political
         and the [inaudible 00:35:57] of the political. You could do what, when and where,
         the idea that a politician can't really save the world. I don't know if I was all
         the way to, "We have to do it," yet, but I think I'm getting there.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was thinking about New York City around the times of the Stonewall Riots. This is
         where those politics come in. I was playing with, what does it mean... I was playing
         with, what's particularly violent political oppression? What are the limits of political
         oppression in a relatively liberal cosmopolitan society? Because I was getting that
         sense of, there's actually a whole lot of ways that political oppression can happen
         that I'd never even thought about at this point, and I was learning about that. So
         I was writing about this character as someone who's experiencing the limits of that
         political oppression. And this is actually one of the key storylines in my opinion,
         and it's ultimately a story about resistance to a kind of political oppression</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This was written obviously before Donald Trump becomes President, and I could see
         all sorts of things about reaction again. But I was seeing the reaction, I was scared.
         I don't know where I got this, there was something bad was coming. I knew that I had
         that sense of fear, so I was writing about... I guess writing a little bit about,
         how do we fight back when things get worse?</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one fic that I was relatively and very
         proud of. To be honest.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And if you're just starting from scratch, then it's
         difficult to create why two people would hate each other so much. I mean, you need
         to have that religious, and
         cultural, and those barriers in order for that to
         happen.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Where I
         just didn't translate them into Rajput or Hindi words. Because I just use
         whatever I knew, because I speak Kannada at home. And that's
         another language entirely. And I was just running out of time, and I said, "You know
         what? No, I'll just handle it myself. And not translate it, and hope that nobody
         minds.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was literally
         just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
         as
         South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
         Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
         and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
         that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
         ideas from.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And
         especially when she has that fight with Jon and she goes back home. And that was,
         I
         think, the point of catharsis. Because especially when you're looking at a lot of
         Indian mothers, and Indian
         women who get into marriages at a very young age. You have to deal with your
         husband's family, you have to deal with that entire kind of stigma. About you
         have to be the one to adjust and to compromise to a far greater extent than your
         husband. And all of these kind of had come together and had
         been marinating for a very long time. And I feel like Sansa, in this, was very much
         the product of that. Where she was
         just trying to fight it, she was such a perfect child in that culture. And then
         suddenly she has to kind of leave her culture behind. Or, not leave her culture
         behind, but adjust to a new culture. And she feels like she's
         being punished by her old one for no fault of her own. And all of it, kind of, her
         desperate unhappiness, her tensions with her mother were a big part of the fic, I
         think, for me.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I
         didn't feel like I could end it with, "Oh, everybody has kids and they're all
         happy." Because that felt very weird, and kind of disjointed with the rest of the
         fic.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And
         in that Sansa can see ghosts. And throughout the entire fic, it's a long fic and
         everything, but one of the biggest issues for me was, how do I end this?</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But to me, it felt like it began with Jon and
         it had to end with Jon. And it had to end with him finally being triumphant, and
         finally being happy for his triumph at the end of this fanfic.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But then the cultural tensions stem almost entirely
         from the differences within their upbringing, I'm pretty sure. Within their
         families. And I mean, there are
         cultural differences within, I mean, people that I've grown up with in India,
         and people in the U.S. And even though you're living side by side, that doesn't
         necessarily mean that you have the same cultural background.
         And I think that's something that both of them don't understand. And both of them
         kind of try to understand slowly.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And if you're talking about other moments,
         like when Sansa wants to give Jon his name, and he asks her to read it out loud. I
         think that's another moment of compromise. Because as much as she's giving him the
         gift,
         she's also giving him his name. And she's stepping across her own cultural
         boundaries to help him with that, which Jon doesn't completely
         understand.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
         that was something that even when you agree to a marriage, and even when you kind
         of
         accept that. Especially when you go into your husband's house, and if you're living
         with his parents and everything. It's a very difficult concept. And it's a very
         difficult idea. And adjusting to that
         is a huge, almost, culture shock to people.
         To any women, adjusting to that is
         difficult. No matter who it is, no matter where you're going.
         So, then, I mean, especially for Sansa, who needs to leave behind her entire family.
         And doesn't even know when she'll be able to go back. And has to go to a foreign country
         without any
         support, and any of her own traditions. She's the one that's upheld every single
         tradition she has ever done. And especially when you're looking at the Hindu
         culture, it's very difficult to uphold them.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, finally, she
         slowly starts to grow into that. She starts to give moments of peace. You know,
         she's kind of giving Jon gifts, and she's trying to bridge that gap. Because she
         also realizes that it's her life, too. Which, I think, is one of the biggest
         realizations that a lot of women have. Which is, "Yes, I'm miserable. I want you to
         be miserable. But how am I going
         to be miserable for?" You need to let some things go, you need to move on past
         the injustices... I need to move past the injustices that I have
         faced.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>The one quote that you picked out here, "You stand before your father, bedecked in
         gossamer and lace and silk, glass thick and shining in your hair." Because that was
         one that I actually remember. Because I initially put the word jewel, and jewels in
         the place of the word glass. But then I wanted it, for her, to feel that it was
         cheaper than the jewel. Even if she had them, they didn't matter to her. Because it
         was just glass.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>As if, her family... Or, she's feeling as if her family is not willing to give
         her as much as she is owed when she's going into a
         marriage.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But then, I also think that one of the major
         things that I learned was probably that some of the anger, it doesn't have to be a
         very you anger to be a very deep one. For it to seep into your writing. Because a
         lot of the time, especially when I'm writing angry stories and everything, they tend
         to be immediate. Like, "Okay, I'm very angry right now. And I want to have a fit.
         And I want to do it." But this was something that it had kind have been, I think,
         brewing for a very long time. And then suddenly the anger, and the angst, and the
         hurt, and the pain, all kind of came out. But at the same time, it was not just
         that. It was also about passing through that anger, and knowing that there is going
         to be someone at the end of it who's willing to accept you.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I hate that I did it, but I did real-person
         fanfiction for Paramore. Thinking of it now, it's always like, "God, that's not
         good. I shouldn't have done it, but here we are."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I'm
         trying to write something that's original, and that's always a bit more of an
         endeavor than you expect it to be.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's funny, going back to the original ones, the
         older ones at least, and reading those, because you sent me one. I think it was
         chapter 37 you mentioned in your email, and I went back and read it and I was like,
         "Oof, I could do this a lot better now, I hope."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a couple that, I don't
         remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
         [inaudible 00:09:21] on purpose, so that it had to be
         like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I also like that you can sort of see a progression of
         how I wrote them and how my own skills have maybe, hopefully developed. And even
         just, it did end up being four years' worth of time</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
         been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
         And maybe, I think,
         during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
         different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
         strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I'm
         very much a person who believes in, if you can't say it in like two words
         then you probably shouldn't. So, I like to have it, what
         is this thing? And that's it. I like to be able to say, "This is what it's going to
         be," and it doesn't necessarily need to be more complicated than that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> So, in this one in particular, she's trying to have a good experience and maybe power
         through it, but then, in that brief lapse where she forgets that she's tied down
         and then she tries to sit up, it's sort of like a muscle memory thing, where
         she's back there the last time she was chained up and couldn't
         move. But also, at the same time, I wanted Asami to immediately
         be there and to be immediately helpful and not push her. She was just trying to be
         comforting. You hear stories about how people
         try and be helpful and just make situations worse, but at this
         point in their relationship, Korra and Asami knew each other super well, and even
         though this is an unusual situation for them, Asami knows how Korra reacts and knows
         who she is and what she's thinking. She's able to help her come back slowly, rather
         than try and make it a quick thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I think I'd notice, not spacing errors, pacing
         errors in that, I could've slowed that down a bit, I could've drawn the reader in
         a
         little bit more, just things like that, where it's just like, "I maybe know how to
         write now," so it hopefully could've made it a little bit more
         engaging.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I
         try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
         to live with a person she loves, doing
         something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
         complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
         obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
         yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
         be happy.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>For
         this particular fic, I think it was just the imagery. I was really trying to grasp
         something that in some ways is so intangible. I was trying so hard to get just that
         feeling of desolation and aching.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But the metaphor itself of the Marching Ants, it was
         this way of articulating the anxiety that comes along with that.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I think it
         just came back to capturing that, the imagery of it, the tone of the chapter, the
         voice of it because, at least to me, it works really hard to put us in Asami's shoes
         and make us experience it exactly as she's experiencing it.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess the sensation of ants ... I come from an area
         where you commonly come into contact with animals and so on, so I'm familiar with
         the actual physical reality of ants crawling across your skin, and there's a way
         that it feels. It's like a sort of weird, prickling sensation that is very
         disconcerting, and I guess I wanted to translate that into how the story reflects
         Asami's own experience with whatever she's feeling. And that imagery just seemed to
         click with that, just the experience of having something under your skin and on your
         skin, even if you can't quite articulate what it is.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
         think I was both going for an understanding of how Asami herself is effected by this
         really terrible thing we see happen to Korra.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's just to be someone who builds and creates
         with the purpose of fixing or making better, but then not being able to do so for
         someone within your personal life. But the imagery also for that chapter was, I guess,
         built in subtext because I wasn't
         quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
         to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
         community.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Of course, being
         younger, you don't really understand romance all
         typically well. It's all very idealized. Then as I got older, I
         started liking to delve more into different types of friendships as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
         Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
         because obviously they wouldn't be having as
         much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
         considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
         day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
         from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
         versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
         wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
         identity. But there would definitely be some push
         back, but how would that change based on the setting?
         I made her a little bit more comfortable in
         her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
         shoulder for Jaime
         who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
         well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>writing it also based off
         of my own experiences, just exploring the LGBT
         community in my area, I was kind of writing it from that
         perspective, but also not having as much information as I would like. </li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>While I do ship them together romantically, I
         wanted to write something that also reflected that you could do like a very intimate
         moment without bring sex into it as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think he definitely
         is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
         means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
         way and being very new, if you're very new into
         like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
         a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
         higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
         or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
         You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
         anything.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It went
         into his relationship with his father, he was caught walking in his mother's red
         heels and he got very scolded and punished for it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>If I were to do this fic over again or
         update it or add on to it, I would definitely
         want to go more into his disability as well as his prosthetic and how it worked
         more. Things like that to sort of flush it out more because I
         don't think in the fic I didn't do the best job I could at it. It was sort of
         something I tried to fill out as much as I could in the fic, but I probably could
         have done better.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was
         definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
         back and explore myself with fan
         fic if I needed to as well.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because I'm
         a length whore. That's the problem. I get into these fics, and I have these ideas,
         and then they expand out of control, and then I get into a story that's suddenly 30
         chapters long, and then I run out of steam. I'm one of those authors who does kind
         of get bored, and then starts cheating on my fic, which is happening right now in
         Game of Thrones.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
         I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
         outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
         really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
         to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a very hard time
         getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
         motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
         are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
         that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
         top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She was
         supposed to kind of get lost in the trees, and they were supposed to find her. But
         I
         thought that was a little bit ignominious for her. So then I remembered, Oh,
         Nimeria's wolf pack. I was like, they haven't used that in the show at all, so why
         not?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's a poem that I really like. I can't remember the name of it now,
         but it talks about moonlight, and how in moonlight, everything is very stark, and
         it's
         clearer for all that starkness. She's seeing everything for who he is.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Sansa is really presented as one of those girls with her
         head in the clouds. She's definitely not a Margaery Tyrell. She was definitely never
         really prepared for court
         life. She has a view of it that is heavily skewed by stories of
         [inaudible 00:33:28] of these wonderful knights in their shining armor, these
         lovely ladies who are just ethereal in their beauty, everything being wrapped up
         in a bow, happily ever after. Maybe something happens, but someone's always
         rescued. And through the series, that kind of gets torn away
         from her bit by bit. The Prince Charming that she thought was a Prince Charming is
         definitely not. There's no one comes to save her. Her brother's more interested in
         being a king than coming to rescue her from the tower, and the monsters inside it.
         So really, Sansa's really forced to grow up,
         and she's really forced to see all these stories as exactly what they are.
         They're just stories. They're empty stories to make children
         happy. So when she's thinking back on this, she's thinking more of the scarier
         stories that maybe she didn't want to listen to.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>What I was afraid of, I should never have
         been afraid of, what I wanted was the thing I should have been worried about.
         She's really kind of flipped the script in her own mind. And
         she's standing amongst these wolves, and it's like before, she would have been
         terrified. She would have been cowering. And now she realizes, this is where I need
         to be. This is where it's at.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
         Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
         without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
         something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
         times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
         I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
         to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
         think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
         sentiment.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
         seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
         woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
         anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
         back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
         Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
         slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
         she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
         jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
         great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
         I've seen it before.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's a smile of, I
         can't think of the word, but being resigned to my fate. And if this is it, then this
         is it. And like I say, she recognizes in Cersei the same evil that she saw in
         Astapor where she's kind of like, "No, you
         would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
         think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
         better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
         are not. You are exactly like them." And in the end, she kind
         of wants to let her know. It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
         that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me. I see exactly what
         you are.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Like I
         said, as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
         be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
         be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself. Kind of like, I hate to use the
         comparison, but if you ever get out of a really bad relationship, and you're just
         like, "No, never again. I know the signs. I will never let that happen to me again."
         And for her of course it's more extreme,
         from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
         decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
         getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
         found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
         myself.</li>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then the last one's a content warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see
         homophobia. I can't not publish a story about homophobia.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It was a piece that was sufficiently about me that it would have been fun and helpful
         for a lot of people. But this, I think it was a good piece, it was a piece that was
         a whole other world to read</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I had a very close group of friends on Live Journal back
         in the early 2000s. That, I think, probably because I was a teenager. Perhaps this
         is because of all those reasons. But that kind of close-knittedness has never kind
         of shown up for me ever since. I think I tend to participate now on more, "Oh, this
         is really interesting for me. And this is really fascinating." And I'll go into it
         for the material as opposed to the friendships themselves.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because,
         initially, it was definitely a very close-knit, just writing for friends and with
         friends.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
         person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
         universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I honestly expected nobody to do
         that. It's good to see that people are just as interested in a lot of it, in this
         stuff. You know?</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was really worried about how it
         would be perceived by the fandom, how it would be received by people even outside
         of
         the fandom.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was
         really worried about it, actually. Because I spoke to a couple people before I
         published the fanfic. Because I was kind of worried about it, and I wasn't sure how
         it would be received.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I wasn't sure people would
         think that it was good enough. Because I was also combining both South Indian and
         North Indian tropes, to a
         certain extent. And those weren't necessarily very compatible. And there's a lot
         of history behind that and everything. And I wasn't entirely
         sure how people would perceive it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong> And I was so
         worried. Because all of this was very close to my heart, and I did not want to have
         to deal with a lot of backlash, or feedback, or having to fight to say, "Well, I
         don't mean to be rude on any of these kinds of things." These are meant with respect
         and they're meant with love. And they're from a part of myself.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
         clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
         Jon is raised a Targaryen.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
         because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
         other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
         fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
         particular tag.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Especially the quote that you put up here,
         which refers to Sansa's eyes. Because that was a moment for me, I think, more than
         anything else.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Oh. I think I learned that people are far more
         understanding than I was giving them credit for, especially because I was so afraid
         about the reception.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. Just, I wanted to get better at it, and people
         were really good at giving me things that I could easily do at work,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
         was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
         think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
         prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
         I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
         I can sort of tailor it to that,"</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
         get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
         distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
         be
         able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
         somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
         something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
         looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
         and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
         is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
         different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
         know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
         way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
         So, I tried to mix it up on occasion.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Things like that, you notice immediately, but also that
         it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
         I
         don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
         trying to get portrayed.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's also, given the
         audience, this is considered a family show. So, I realized over time that maybe I
         don't have to write that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
         it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
         press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
         slaves is super ... I didn't want to
         contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
         [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
         more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
         been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
         thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I learned to just not push it,
         don't write what other people are demanding, necessarily.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>My audience should be myself, at the end of the day. I
         want to write the things that I want to read. Even if I'd much rather prefer just
         reading it and not having to put the time and effort into clacking my way through
         it, if I want to read it, I have to write it sometimes, which is fine. But I should
         enjoy the things that I'm writing.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's just to be someone who builds and creates
         with the purpose of fixing or making better, but then not being able to do so for
         someone within your personal life. But the imagery also for that chapter was, I guess,
         built in subtext because I wasn't
         quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
         to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
         community.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> It has less to do with fandom
         itself and more to do with the external world. And even now it's, I guess it's ...
         I
         don't know. I think it
         just seemed like the safer option at the time.  But the more
         time I've spent in that part of fandom, the less I guess I've cared about how it's
         read or whatever it is. But at the time, it just seemed wiser, particularly if I was
         having others who may not ... Because fan works and original work for me are on the
         same level, and so I'm not concerned, I guess, with people reading it for ... people
         reading it and not seeing a difference in quality, but rather how they experience
         the content. And so I think I was still considering who the audience would
         be.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because there is this thing in fanfiction where we
         assume that all people who are accessing it are familiar with the text. And while
         that is often common when we want it to function beyond that world to have relevance
         in other ways, I think for me personally it's important to integrate more parts of
         the world, of the universe.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>For me, it was just reminding myself that, even though I'm
         writing something where there are people who are familiar with the text, it's also
         important to fill in the blanks sometimes.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It's
         something that I wanted to, again, wanted to bring into a fanfic to kind of make it
         more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and
         wondering the same thing.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
         I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
         outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
         really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
         to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
         thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
         in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
         and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
         unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
         me
         try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
         There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
         improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
         The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
         right.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Ratings may change, warnings may change, series,
         spoilers, all those kind of speak for themselves, just to let you know that okay,
         once again, this isn't static. This is something that changes story by story. Some
         of them may be Gen, some of them, I haven't written one yet, but some of them may
         be
         adult in the future. Some of them may have a lot of violence in them, so just be
         aware. Don't ever come back to this fic and think, "This is what it is." Because
         that's not it.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
         never know. I think my
         characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
         "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
         it may be out of character."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
         divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
         want to get blasted on that one.</li>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
         have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
         in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
         I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
         convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
         arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
         very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
         you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
         original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
         through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
         and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
         with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
         get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
         you.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was coming into my own politically, I was becoming my own political individual in
         a way I hadn't been before. Like I had politics, but this is around the time that
         I'm really radicalized, and just me engaging with those contexts.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
         I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
         already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
         weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
         I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
         but it felt more like a nod than a full</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
         there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
         feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
         a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
         different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
         in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
         and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
         looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>but this is what I was doing with my life. I was on my way to running a queer resource
         center at a college, so I was doing the work of feeling the political implications
         of things in the world. And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about
         is to write about... Not just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia,
         not just homophobia, but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because
         this was the thing that was radicalizing me, [inaudible] is vile, because... And it
         was about violence, so I don't just mean violence as a method of resistance, I mean
         violence as a thing that people survive. Because that's what's radicalizing me at
         the time. And so I felt the need to wake up that in a sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political
         institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family
         institutions. My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community
         college is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of
         people that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't
         talk about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
         that was the only source of information.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was trying to write a story that engaged with trauma and felt authentic and didn't
         make trauma seem like the end of the world. Because the binary that's in a lot of
         literature is either like, "Oh, you either overcame trauma, or you are doomed to misery
         forever." And I was trying to find some middle ground, trying to tell a story that
         felt authentic.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to tell a story about connection. And I wanted to make it clear that when
         I'm telling the story, I think that even [inaudible 00:26:39] understands that it's
         not really about romance as much as it is about feeling connected in a genuine way
         to people, that that central theme, building a life worth living after injury, or
         after trauma, is finding an authentic realtionship with people.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>In the context of this piece, a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois
         radical is that I'm not going to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really
         have a sense of class politics at the time, or have the beginnings of that study.
         That's only beginning to be born</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to give a sense of what is the politics of the Northern Water Tribe? And
         I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water Tribe,
         or is not criminalized anymore. Also I wanted to say this is a different relationship.
         But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give
         up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I've also recently published work in Fleabag, which
         was one of the fandoms that I had to write for for my Yuletide assignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>There's a couple of things that you see that are kind of
         interesting, and then you kind of identify a certain actor, or a certain character
         that you kind of find interesting. And then jump from there to another.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yes. I think my most recent published fanfiction is a
         Percy Weasley, second person point of view, post canon. In which he is attempting
         to
         basically restructure his society by running on a platform of big structural change.
         Which might sound vaguely familiar.  But it was, I
         think, mostly due to the kind of deep rage that I was feeling over the entire
         Democratic Primaries over the past couple of months. And almost the past year.
         In which everything felt very much like a lot of talk, and not a lot of doing.
         And at some point, you need some catharsis. And kind of putting it out into
         fiction and seeing something changing. Or, not even seeing something changing.
         But seeing people trying to effect change, and willing to fight for that change
         felt very important to me. And basically that entire fanfic is kind of born out
         of that seething, massive, "I want to see something happening."
         And I will see it happen in fiction, if not in reality.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>was talking about that, and I felt like
         that was a really fascinating look into that psyche. And seeing how Fleabag and the
         Priest would meet up. And how they would be after having separated for 20, 30 years,
         coming back to see each other after they have had full lives apart, but somehow
         still wanting something more. Which, I think, it's definitely, kind of, for me, I
         am
         not old enough to be discussing 50 year old, 60 year old life plans. But my life
         path has never been very straight, or what I felt that it would be. Because when I
         was, what? 15, I probably thought I'd be an engineer. And then after that I thought
         I'd be a doctor. And then, suddenly, now I'm a lawyer. And I thought I'd be in the
         U.S., and I'm in India. And it's a very wildly divergent and strange life path for
         me. And that's only been over, what? 10 years, 10, 15 years. And I can't even
         imagine how that would be over 20, 30 years. And identifying that desire for home,
         and wanting people to be that. As opposed to a given area, or a given job, or
         anything like that, felt very poignant to me at that particular point in
         time.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
         the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
         Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
         film."</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I mean, I think the
         choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
         setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
         trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
         for it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
         view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
         you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
         of
         view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
         what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
         more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one of the
         primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
         sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
         very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
         queer
         characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
         go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
         their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
         situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, it was definitely, when I first started it, it
         was, "Okay, well, I kind of just want to write, and I want to get better at writing,
         practicing it." I started it in college, and the professor I had at that time kept
         saying how, "If you want to get better at writing, you have to write 50,000 words,
         and then, you have to write another 50,000." "Really? All right. I'll just write,
         then. People will give me prompts and I'll just write those as they come in." And
         then, there were a lot of prompts that came in, surprisingly. I was able to stay
         consistent with it for, I want to say, two, three years.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I didn't necessarily want to
         do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to
         a
         point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
         each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
         all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
         can't."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I would start to feel guilty, and sometimes
         would just push one out whether or not I felt it was up to par, even though I hoped
         it was.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
         only get a certain amount of them in canon.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
         it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
         since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
         until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
         a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
         decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
         this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
         case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
         Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
         bit.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, for that chapter, I want to say, like everything
         else in the collection, it was a prompt, but it was something that I didn't want to
         ham-fist it, because Korra's definitely, she's
         traumatized. We see that more than once,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, again, it was the prompts, but it was
         also, I have personally been a little conflicted on gender for a while, and it's
         like my sexuality, it was something that I sort of just say, "Well, I'll get to
         that when I have the chance." So, it's always just sort of in
         the back of my head</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
         serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
         just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
         things that made me super uncomfortable.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
         though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
         for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>It was
         partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
         Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I wanted it to, like everything
         else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
         to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And I also wanted to give the collection itself a
         sendoff I was proud of. So, I spent a little bit more time on that than I did a lot
         of the other stuff, just let it marinate. "You know what? This is a good end, and
         hope you enjoyed," sort of thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So now,
         I sort of write when I want to, when I have the motivation. And if I'm feeling it,
         yeah, I'll do a little bit. Like somebody requested a prompt two weeks ago. I was
         like, "You know what? Why not. I'm feeling it. We're going to go for it."</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think I started writing
         fan fiction in earnest because I was homesick. Because I had recently moved, and so
         it was with the intent of writing something that was close to home but also part of
         fandom that I started doing that.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I
         think with Twilight it was just that phase where you finally find a
         story that speaks to you, even if you kind of hate it when you look back at it when
         you're older. But at the time, how
         Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
         small community and so forth and deals with depression or
         whatever it is, it just seemed to be something that I could relate to. And so
         I was both interested in that, and I guess in the power fantasy that she was written
         to
         come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
         characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
         was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
         happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background
         and
         the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
         that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
         Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
         I
         could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
         been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
         how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I kind of wanted to see that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular,
         and this was surprising for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I
         never really remember to think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like
         there was this big gap available to us for exploration.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So I kind of wanted to explore that and see how
         Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for me I like to see how the characters
         are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to
         them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
         And in terms of relationships and love and so forth, it was I guess just coming back
         to what I like to explore in fiction, which is how people are interacting with each
         other, what it means for them. And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
         not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
         audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
         exploration. So I like to see for myself how their worth is existing within these
         relationships, what it means for them and what it can mean for the audience and so
         forth.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
         came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
         that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Whereas, for
         Asami, Asami didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have
         anyone. So she went back to someone, I
         guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
         for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
         act of violence ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore
         that. It's just fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow
         still find a way to circle back around to the people who have hurt
         them.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So both as a black person and as a woman, it was
         just important for me to recognize that in text and get around to exploring what
         that might have meant for other characters who weren't within the Circle of the
         Avatar and had powerful connections.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
         to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
         bi-sexual. I used it sort of as a tool in some fanfics to work
         through ideas or feelings that I'd had and didn't know how to properly verbalize
         yet. I was putting them on paper, using another
         character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
         where I felt I was kind of safe to do so. I didn't always
         publish all of them, but the one that you contacted me over, I did,
         obviously.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was around the
         time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary and
         I tried to sort of work things out with Jaime as the main focal character</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It's
         something that I wanted to, again, wanted to bring into a fanfic to kind of make it
         more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and
         wondering the same thing.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
         them being intimate, but it was all
         very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
         vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
         I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
         own instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I really wanted
         to address the gender issue and the gender questioning and write how the
         experiences hit the hardest for me when I was thinking about
         it. Definitely.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
         wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
         their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
         that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
         work through those emotions with me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
         Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
         Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
         no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
         brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
         thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
         wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
         series, the first one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
         know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
         And
         it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
         What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
         And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
         and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
         the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
         that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
         world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
         would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
         maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
         how I got into that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
         think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
         little bit of character assassination.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted to kind of show a Sansa who was still herself.
         A Sansa who was willing to not listen to him, who
         understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
         manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
         only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
         run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
         ends are." That's kind of where that idea came from.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
         of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
         That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
         delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
         Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
         away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
         one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
         fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
         of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
         if I was a former slave. The one thing I
         would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
         in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
         into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
         anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
         like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
         underused character.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I adore the Dorne
         storyline in the books, and they completely butchered it in the show. So, that's why
         I
         was like, no Dorne's way smarter than this. So yes, he's going to be the Dorne that
         you
         get in the books.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
         dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
         that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
         Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
         beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
         thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because
         I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I also learned that you have to be careful with how much to take on, and you have
         to be careful about what you're willing to prune, and you have to be ready to prune
         things. And you have to be ready to follow a story where it goes instead of trying
         to follow all the directions you ever imagined. Because if you try to follow a story
         in every direction you have, then it's going to die like this piece did. It's like,
         "I don't know how to integrate the story into itself anymore."</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I did a very brief
         look over and then I was like, "Screw it,"</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's actually a lot more of that fic that is written
         that didn't make it in. A whole thing where you get it from Nimeria's point of view
         where you can see her. She's like, okay, just following to see what's going to
         happen. And then when Sansa decides to run, that's when she decides to attack. But
         I
         thought that was a bit superfluous, so I took all of that out.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a lot of Game of Thrones stuff on the cutting
         room floor, before I decided what to actually post. And there is about 20 other
         drabbles for the one series that haven't made it yet, because I'm one of those

      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Mostly to keep
         myself writing. Because, otherwise, I would just not publish those materials until
         it becomes, you know. It's basically sitting on my hard drive for years and years
         on
         end, and finally I get the opportunity and the motivation to publish them.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But when I was making the
         actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
         actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
         identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
         identify.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because that's what I keep feeling whenever I look back at
         it, was how I got almost consumed by the characters when I was writing them.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I wrote it in
         one sitting in a Starbucks near my university.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That, and also trying to write
         and finish an entire fanfic in one sitting is very difficult when it's in a public
         setting. Luckily, it happened and it was a nice exercise as well, just also to be
         able to sit and write and have it really done in one sitting and then put it out
         there was very satisfying.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I guess I wanted to
         get a very powerful moment on paper. I had all these ideas and notes about what was
         also going on in the universe and what not, but this was the one that kind of
         started it. I wanted to make sure that I could get it down and not have it be that
         fanfic that I write in my head and then I just cannot put on paper later on.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, so at the
         same time I was writing this fanfic, I was writing another one that kind of delved
         into the timeline of how Jaime grew up.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>The first big one
         is never write an entire fanfic in Starbucks.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
         written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
         okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
         alone.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's not done. It's not a solid 200 pages. I'm a very
         chaotic writer, so I will get a bit of dialog in my head. I will see something, and
         I will kind of write around that, and build around that, and string a bunch of
         scenes. It's 200 pages, but it's 200 pages of broken up paragraphs, bits of dialog,
         bits of scenery. So if I ever fleshed it out, it would be much longer, because I
         have a problem containing myself.</li>

   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because
         I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I would also say a little bit about some of the research I'd read at the time, turns
         out the book I was reading at the time that claimed that knowing someone who was gay
         had a significant...Or not knowing someone who was gay, but engaging with someone
         who's gay on the topic of being gay helped significantly with changing someone's political
         views, or being willing to accept gay people. Turns out that one was actually wrong,
         like literally the person who put together that study cooked the book.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that for
         the actual research it was not so much that I did it for this particular fanfic, as
         it was more that I love that era a lot. So, I had tended to research it before, as
         well. So, I had a lot of information that I kind of knew in colloquial terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I did
         not remember the exact way that he had died, so then I kind of went searching for
         that. And then, I mean, from there it kind of spiraled into researching other things
         and kind of reading up more about Akbar and more about Jodhaa. And I'm an avid
         research. I mean, that's what I do now.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think a lot of the research and a lot of the material
         was just about identifying and pulling disparate ideas together that I knew.
         From either my own culture because, of course,
         this is partially my own culture. And also, the historical
         details of [inaudible 00:27:49].</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think that was what
         was very important to me, especially in this story, was puling it all together so
         that there weren't any open endings. And the research really, somehow, it helped in
         pulling that together.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that the
         thing I wanted to keep in mind was that I was doing the research, but I was also not
         putting as much research into it as I probably should have if I wanted to make it
         historical fiction.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And that was one thing I wanted to be clear about.
         Because, yes, it was research. But I think I wanted to keep to the spirit of the
         movie, as well as the spirit of the A Song of Ice and Fire canon.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
         that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
         most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
         see what they're going through and you see how their lives are,
         and I try not to speak for situations that I've never lived through, but you can
         draw knowledge from that and say, "Okay, well, without going in depth into feelings
         or things like that, I can add this, this, and this, and make it maybe relatable in
         that regard."</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>This is a topic
         that I was a little bit hesitant to tackle because at the time, when I was writing,
         I wasn't very well-versed in
         not just having a limb missing as a disability, but also how advanced the
         prosthetics were and if they could hold things. I did a little
         bit of research while I was at Starbucks, trying to sort of complete
         everything.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I learned a little bit, I actually had to do a bit of
         research on some of the fic, for things like trauma, and how people respond to
         trauma. Especially in the case of Sansa and Missandei, how do people overcome
         certain difficulties after being in these different positions? That was a little bit
         interesting. I did a little bit of in-depth on that, because once again, I'm that
         nerd.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, mostly
         it was Googling, recovering from trauma. I did a little bit of research on former
         slaves, to see their mindset. That was a little bit what I did use for the mindset
         of Missandei. Because people who've been in that situation, they go through, what
         is
         it called? No, goodness, I can't remember. But it was a very good article, and it
         was talking about how former slaves, they go through this process of not believing
         that they're free, and not believing that they're free, and not believing that
         they're free. And eventually, they get to a
         point where it sticks in their head, that this is freedom. This is what they
         have. No one can control them. And then, they get very, very almost violently
         independent, where no one's going to tell me what to do. You can't tell me what
         to do. No one's going to do that to me. Once again, how some
         people where to a much lesser extent, when you get out of controlling, overbearing
         relationships, and then you're finally free, and you're like, "Fuck that shit. Where
         am I going? I'm staying out all night. And I don't have to tell anybody."
         They get this burst of a sense of self, a
         sense of purpose. And I thought that was very beautiful, that there are people
         who can go through all that type of trauma, and they can get there, and they can
         fully bloom. And I always saw Missandei as kind of that character, this
         character who had gone through all of that to the point where here she is,
         standing tall as a character that knows her own worth, knows her own
         personage.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then with Sansa, just how people recover
         from abusive and traumatic relationships, and things like that. The stages of
         recovery.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
         the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
         so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
         Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
         and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But that was the biggest bit of feedback I got was this conversation, and it helped
         a little bit.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And that also came across to a lot of readers, is what
         they were telling me, at least. Because they felt like there was a lot more gravitas
         to the entire fic that you wouldn't see in a lot of my other
         fanfics.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But people were very kind about it. And I haven't
         actually gotten a single negative feedback on that fanfic to date.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, with all of that in mind, the actual fandom
         response was absolutely wonderful, and absolutely, completely respectful. And none
         of my fears at all came to fruition.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because they were all so kind, and so respectful of the entire fic in
         general.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
         a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
         always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
         at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
         art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
         it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
         person's mind."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I like that a lot of people, I still get comments
         occasionally that are, "I've just gone through this whole thing," and you can do
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, if there were some things where I'd write the
         original drabble, and then I might get three more immediate requests in my inbox for
         a sequel, or for, "Can I get a full length thing of this?" And I didn't necessarily
         have the time or energy, or just the inclination in some cases.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I mean, most
         of it was positive, which was really good. If somebody really didn't like something,
         they didn't usually tell me. Or if they did, sometimes it was like a spelling error
         or a formatting error, and it'd be, "Okay, I can just easily fix that." I don't
         think there were too many outright negative things. There was one. I don't think it
         was on a prompt, but this artist I really liked at the time commented and said
         something like, "This would've been better with this movie instead of the one you
         actually used," and didn't necessarily anything positive otherwise. I don't know if
         they actually liked it, or if it was just sort of a, "Well, I would've liked it
         better if you'd done this thing the way I wanted you to." Which, it is what it is,
         and you sort of have to just say, "Okay, well, this is the way I did it, and I'm not
         going to change it." But it was definitely a situation where I was like, "Okay.
         Don't know what to make of that."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Most of the time, people are very, very happy about
         it, because it was just another thing for them to read.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And
         okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
         notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
         figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
         she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
         Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
         things stand out immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's okay that maybe only three other people
         also liked it, but I like it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I got a very
         interesting response from someone. I believe, maybe a week or two after. They were
         like, "It's a really well written fanfic, it's great, but why in God's (capital G)
         name, did you make Jaime like this?" And the moment I saw capital G, I was like I
         see. I tried to be as cordial as I could and I explained what I said earlier about
         my inspiration</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, that was the one big kick
         back I got from someone. I was a little bit shocked that I got the capital G person,
         but what can you do?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then that's when I kind of got feedback, because the
         first fanfic, I never got any feedback from anyone. I was just like, "Oh, I'm
         shouting into the dark." So yeah, it kind of changed, and it got me a bit more
         active, and like, people actually want to say something about it. What did you think
         about it? I started getting a bit more communication, a bit more activity.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And someone wrote a really detailed review, just about
         how, I remember they said they could taste the road dust from my writing. And I was
         like, wow. I never thought of it that way. That's really cool. That kind of inspired
         me to write more, that I could get that emotion out of somebody. They felt like they
         were actually there with them.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I've had a
         couple requests from the other ones. They're like, "I would love to read this
         story." I'm like, "No, you don't understand. It's a lot to wade
         through."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
         "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
         People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
         right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
         never know. I think my
         characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
         "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
         it may be out of character."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But there are people who
         they're really willing to engage with you, and they have questions. In a lot of
         other fandoms, some people are just like, "This is a nice story." Game of Thrones
         fans will have questions for you in the comments. They'll be like, "What about this?
         And what about this? Oh, what about this? What do you think about this?" It's fun
         to
         get that dialog. That's something I never had before.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>In one of my other fics, there's the Deviant Lord. We
         will run out of the character requirement, talking to each other back and forth in
         comments about things.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually
         had one troll who just wrote, "Fuck you, you bastard." And I was like, yes. I was
         just like, "Whoa. Okay. I'm sorry you're having such a bad day. Go have a mimosa.
         Just don't take it out on me."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But
         there are just people who are just nasty. In all the fandoms I've been in, it
         thankfully hasn't happened to me yet, and I've actually had people defend me in
         comments. They're just like, "Get that shit out of here." I'm like, "Okay, thank you
         for being nice." But it seems the Game of Thrones fandoms can get real violent. They
         get real virulent with their hatred in the comments section. I can't muster that
         kind of hatred. If I don't like something, I just click off of it. I don't get the
         hate.</li>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
         have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
         in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
         very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
         you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
         original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
         through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
         and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
         with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
         get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
         you.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
         I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
         already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
         weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
         I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
         but it felt more like a nod than a full</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
         there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
         feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
         a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
         different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
         in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
         and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
         looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political
         institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family
         institutions. My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community
         college is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of
         people that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't
         talk about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
         that was the only source of information.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
         a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
         but it's good.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad.
         But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want
         to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want
         to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that!
         I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.[inaudible 00:47:08]
         what are other ways we can imagine it?</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So then I realized that Jodhaa Akbar, which is
         definitely a Desi film, had a wonderful set of characters that was definitely
         angsty, but had a wonderfully happy ending. And allowed me to write about something
         that was kind of dear to my heart as well. Because it was a Desi film. It was one
         representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
         those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
         to bridge them. Because you have to. Because it's not just
         about love, or it's not just about anything. It's about your pride, it's about your
         family's livelihood. All of those kind of come together, you have to do it. You
         don't want to, but, somehow, you have to. I think it's that gritting of your teeth,
         and getting on with life that kind of really draws me in.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean that I just don't think I relate to him at the
         same extent that I relate to Sansa.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think if you look at A Song of Ice and Fire, technically,
         more than Game of Thrones, you
         actually get more of a cultural tension due to just the difference between the
         North and the South. And all of that. And I do think that George R. R. Martin
         has kind of perpetuated the idea, simply because he is English. So, the whole
         idea that in England, where Northerners are tougher and everything than
         Southerners. And I don't know anything more about it. But I think that's kind of
         one of the underlying and unconscious biases within the framework of the
         canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, obviously, Season Eight was terrible.
         That was a given. And the ending did not do anyone any favors.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And second of all, the actual TV show was not doing itself any
         favors. </li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah, I mean, I think
         when I was first getting into the fandom,
         one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
         strong. And it's true to a great extent. But I think what's
         even more fascinating to me, is how a lot of them tend to show that strength in so
         many different ways. Like, you have Sansa, who
         is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
         of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
         conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
         world. And then you have people like Margaery Tyrell and Cersei
         Lannister,</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I actually do remember how unhappy people were that Sansa didn't
         end with a love interest at the end of Season Eight.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I
         think it's just a relief to see how... Because to me, it's almost like a moment of
         such growth, is what I felt, when I felt Sansa. Because when you're young,
         [inaudible 01:20:56]. You want the perfect marriage, and
         the perfect husband, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't mean that
         you'll necessarily get it. And to me, at least, growing up is balancing those
         childhood desires, and those childhood needs with whatever you learn as you grow up.
         And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
         child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
         sure that nobody hurt her.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think
         there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
         liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
         everything.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, obviously, there's a ton of other problems. How [inaudible
         01:21:42] Daenerys, and Cersei, and Jaime. And a number of other characters.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I could understand why people felt unhappy about it. But at the same time, I
         think you're beating on the wrong bush here. There's a lot of other problems to deal
         with within this fandom. And within this canon that we don't particularly need as
         much as you're putting into it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
         very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
         queer
         characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
         go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
         their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
         situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
         don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
         came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
         into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
         ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Okay, well, let's just do Korra next," because I was pretty sure
         that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
         of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
         of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
         watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I was very much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
         and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
         style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
         seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
         once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
         not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
         the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
         there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
         </li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
         super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
         of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
         relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
         should take five steps back, and let's just
         focus on these two.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> That was
         Christmas break, but my grandma was staying over for the weekend, so I had to watch
         it silently at like midnight, and freak out quietly. As soon as Asami showed up on
         the screen, I must have lost
         it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
         happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I loved that. Even if, and I think
         once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
         maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
         to see
         that, but I liked that they
         weren't immediate, for the most part.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
         it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
         since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
         until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
         a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
         decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
         this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
         case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
         Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
         bit.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
         was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
         possible love interests.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, we spend four seasons developing
         Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
         lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
         out</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
         see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
         god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
         have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it was also good that
         nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
         communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
         white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
         frankly.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
         watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
         because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
         and so on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At the
         time that the show was airing, it was kind of taboo for
         divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
         portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
         it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And because I grew up in a country
         where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian content was part of our
         regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened, so it shaped what I was
         interested in.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I
         think with Twilight it was just that phase where you finally find a
         story that speaks to you, even if you kind of hate it when you look back at it when
         you're older. But at the time, how
         Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
         small community and so forth and deals with depression or
         whatever it is, it just seemed to be something that I could relate to. And so
         I was both interested in that, and I guess in the power fantasy that she was written
         to
         come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
         characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it was more
         that it was very books for me because I grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on
         South America but as socially, politically part of the Caribbean, so most of the
         content that we were consuming was either shows from the US or whatever, maybe
         European shows might have filtered through, and that also was the case for the
         books that we were reading. And while it was the case within school for us to
         consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to read Caribbean literature as a
         person on my own.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So it was just discovering a collection of books in my
         own home from my aunt and my mother and so on, their teachers. And my aunt in particular,
         she
         teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
         them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
         were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
         know. I guess it comes back to not knowing what you're missing
         until you finally have it. So when I first read texts were people
         were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living
         in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et
         cetera.
         Because even though I speak, let's say,
         like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
         home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
         speak English, but it's a particular kind of English. So just
         seeing that in text and then realizing that the fantasies and so on that I was
         consuming were ... I don't know, it had these strange things that just didn't quite
         compute with where I was living. That's where it really clicked for me. And from
         that point onward, I think that's where I began to see it in everything else. The
         biggest shift didn't really come until I moved to the US, because back home I was
         part of the
         majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing yourself in other
         ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in the news as a
         politician, et cetera. But here it was a completely different
         ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
         was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
         happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background
         and
         the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
         that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
         Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
         I
         could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
         been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
         how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
         came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
         that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think
         in the first two books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I
         guess her experiences are fantastical in a sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It was sort of ... To me,
         it was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is
         this all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having
         this really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once
         had, and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to
         deal with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so
         forth.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't know, it just ... There may have been
         other works of fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that
         was when Korra just seemed more human.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korra gets to her lowest point.  The implication is that she's about to jump off a
         cliff. But
         we don't really get to dwell in the true feeling of that moment, the have to fix
         it immediately because of the idea that the show may never get to come back to
         this point, so we don't get to actually see what that means for
         her.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>we see Korra actual deal, for more than one episode, with how
         she's effected by these things, and to me that was different.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>You actually get to see an
         avatar. And yes, Aang did deal with this too, but it's ... I don't know.
         It's just different for me.
         Deal with PTSD and depression and just all these changing
         things. It was interesting.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>everyone has seen someone who they think is
         all-powerful and infallible, invulnerable to an extent, be ... I don't want to say
         broken, but be injured in a
         really drastic way and them not being able to do anything much to help with her
         recovery in concrete ways.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think
         it's just existing personally as a marginalized person. The way that that storyline
         was handled in LOK, I think I wasn't quite comfortable with it, just the very idea
         of the movement disappearing because of one man's end. It seems so unrealistic
         because there was a real situation with inequality there. Because we see that the
         world has adapted to cater for benders, and we don't quite know non-benders are
         faring in that world, what kind of opportunities they're having. And based on the
         conflict that the show raised, it was clear that non-benders were in a position
         where they weren't having ends meet or they weren't getting the jobs that they hoped
         to get.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
         interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
         we
         kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
         thing about fandom
         and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
         either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
         enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
         in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
         world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
         through.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular,
         I think it's fascinating that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all
         these really powerful girl and women characters who were, for the most part,
         respected, at least in later years. Because when we first meet
         the Avatar world, we know that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all
         this power, she's in this position where she could eventually have the throne, she
         isn't respected by her own father.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But even Katara in the beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use
         waterbending beyond healing, and she goes on to become one of
         the greatest waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have
         this really powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends
         someone who is, up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more
         ruthless and so forth. So it was
         interesting to see all these female characters get to be complex and powerful
         and not have that held against them, unless you count Azula and
         how that ended for her.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But it was nice to see the LOK universe expand
         upon that and show us that things had changed in some ways. For one, we have Korra,
         who is the avatar, and she is this
         figure who is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity
         that we're accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants
         without concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think
         about her gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering
         herself inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this
         particular form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin
         and we see Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or
         they're dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with
         their mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well,
         if they do have children, and so forth. I don't know. It was an
         example of how that world had changed or was changing possibly for the
         better.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I'm
         like, "In what world am I supposed to view this as platonic? I mean, I know I was
         raised
         in a pretty fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing
         here things that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
         00:58:53] people." So that's when I became a
         believer. And the longer I watched the show, the more it seemed to grow.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And
         you could tell, from a fandom perspective, some people who are cishet won't be able
         to speak to
         this, but you could tell that the writer's room was split in
         how they were portraying the characters because I think they got uncomfortable with
         how fandom
         was growing so rapidly and intensely around these two
         characters, even
         to the point where they used the black character as a wedge between
         them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
         in that show. </li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But we basically had these two
         actors leaning into it because they didn't have a problem with
         it, but we see that some of the writers were
         uncomfortable, or I guess maybe the network or the showrunners were
         uncomfortable where the story was heading. And so they moved
         away from what was organically developing to the extent where they took two
         characters who never said more than a single word to each other, and one of these
         characters actively disliked the other character, and said, "Hey, we're going to
         have these two put together. And we are
         going to have your favorite superhero be shipped with a slave
         owner. So, yay, have fun with that."</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So
         when you start off with a show that has ... It's basically girl-next-door, blonde,
         blue-eyed, sort of
         hyper-feminine in some ways but also gender non-conforming in other ways super
         hero dating a
         black man, or having that black man being put as a love interest when that's
         usually not the case, especially for that kind of media.
         And then you break them apart in the
         second season and conveniently replace him with a white man who just actually
         makes the character feel terrible and derails her show, and starts to get almost as
         much screen
         time as she does even though he's not really an integral part of the show. Just
         so much went wrong so fast. He was so bad.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I just find their relationship in
         canon to be so interesting because it was one of
         the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
         pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
         surprised.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Brienne was what a lot of
         these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
         places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
         and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
         of her issues with not being able
         to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
         heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
         always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
         gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
         he always had a very strange affinity, but
         like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
         loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
         of view.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
         reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
         very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
         and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>as like a side note, I think the show really undercut Jaime and Brienne's
         relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
         kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her. I was
         like, "Boy is a head shorter than her."</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That was part of the appeal was that Jaime had this big, beautiful wife that was taller
         than him
         and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
         wonderful?" That was part of what made it so enjoyable</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think that bit of the
         ending, was actually the one I had the least amount of problems with, out of all of
         it because its part of the King's guard. This was like an ideal kind of took Jaime's
         spot in like the head.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I mean, personally, I think the whole bit where he leaves and comes
         back is bullshit. Like, I'm sorry, I can't even mince words with that</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That would have been a good way to end it, not, we're going to hug
         each other and we're going to let some rocks fall.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I knew everything that was going to
         happen until about Season Four. And was perfectly happy with it, really wasn't
         paying any attention.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
         Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
         Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
         no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
         brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
         thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
         wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
         series, the first one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
         think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
         little bit of character assassination.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong> So seeing that, and kind of juxtaposing it against the Sansa
         we were getting in the show was a little irksome.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I literally got up off the couch and walked away when
         she got beheaded. I was very upset. It pissed me
         off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
         slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
         did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
         white women. That was very, very frustrating and irritating to
         me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That seemed completely out of
         character for me. The whole scene was out of character for me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
         of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
         That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I adore the Dorne
         storyline in the books, and they completely butchered it in the show. So, that's why
         I
         was like, no Dorne's way smarter than this. So yes, he's going to be the Dorne that
         you
         get in the books.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
         that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
         better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
         they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
         would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23].</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
         dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
         that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
         Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
         beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
         thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually liked
         Sandor Clegane, Sansa Stark as a pairing, whether it's through platonic, whether
         it's romantic, et cetera. It was just one of those good ones. I thought they had
         good scene chemistry together. I always thought he kind of saw her,
         especially in the beginning as, he called her a little bird. Like, "I see that your
         parents never prepared you for this. Your best safe kept in a cage locked away, and
         you
         can just sing to people." I always liked that about him.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
         and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
         stalker-y.</li>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
         I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
         but it felt more like a nod than a full</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
         a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
         but it's good.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad.
         But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want
         to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want
         to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that!
         I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.[inaudible 00:47:08]
         what are other ways we can imagine it?</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah, I mean, I think
         when I was first getting into the fandom,
         one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
         strong. And it's true to a great extent. But I think what's
         even more fascinating to me, is how a lot of them tend to show that strength in so
         many different ways. Like, you have Sansa, who
         is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
         of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
         conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
         world. And then you have people like Margaery Tyrell and Cersei
         Lannister,</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I
         think it's just a relief to see how... Because to me, it's almost like a moment of
         such growth, is what I felt, when I felt Sansa. Because when you're young,
         [inaudible 01:20:56]. You want the perfect marriage, and
         the perfect husband, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't mean that
         you'll necessarily get it. And to me, at least, growing up is balancing those
         childhood desires, and those childhood needs with whatever you learn as you grow up.
         And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
         child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
         sure that nobody hurt her.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think
         there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
         liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
         everything.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Okay, well, let's just do Korra next," because I was pretty sure
         that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
         of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
         of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
         watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I was very much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
         and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
         style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> That was
         Christmas break, but my grandma was staying over for the weekend, so I had to watch
         it silently at like midnight, and freak out quietly. As soon as Asami showed up on
         the screen, I must have lost
         it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
         happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I loved that. Even if, and I think
         once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
         maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
         to see
         that, but I liked that they
         weren't immediate, for the most part.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, we spend four seasons developing
         Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
         lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
         out</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
         see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
         god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
         have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it was also good that
         nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
         communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
         white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
         frankly.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At the
         time that the show was airing, it was kind of taboo for
         divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
         portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
         it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
         was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
         happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background
         and
         the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
         that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
         Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
         I
         could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
         been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
         how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
         came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
         that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It was sort of ... To me,
         it was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is
         this all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having
         this really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once
         had, and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to
         deal with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so
         forth.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>we see Korra actual deal, for more than one episode, with how
         she's effected by these things, and to me that was different.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular,
         I think it's fascinating that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all
         these really powerful girl and women characters who were, for the most part,
         respected, at least in later years. Because when we first meet
         the Avatar world, we know that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all
         this power, she's in this position where she could eventually have the throne, she
         isn't respected by her own father.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But even Katara in the beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use
         waterbending beyond healing, and she goes on to become one of
         the greatest waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have
         this really powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends
         someone who is, up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more
         ruthless and so forth. So it was
         interesting to see all these female characters get to be complex and powerful
         and not have that held against them, unless you count Azula and
         how that ended for her.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But it was nice to see the LOK universe expand
         upon that and show us that things had changed in some ways. For one, we have Korra,
         who is the avatar, and she is this
         figure who is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity
         that we're accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants
         without concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think
         about her gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering
         herself inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this
         particular form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin
         and we see Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or
         they're dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with
         their mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well,
         if they do have children, and so forth. I don't know. It was an
         example of how that world had changed or was changing possibly for the
         better.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I just find their relationship in
         canon to be so interesting because it was one of
         the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
         pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
         surprised.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Brienne was what a lot of
         these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
         places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
         and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
         of her issues with not being able
         to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
         heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
         always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
         gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
         he always had a very strange affinity, but
         like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
         loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point

         and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That was part of the appeal was that Jaime had this big, beautiful wife that was taller
         than him
         and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
         wonderful?" That was part of what made it so enjoyable</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think that bit of the
         ending, was actually the one I had the least amount of problems with, out of all of
         it because its part of the King's guard. This was like an ideal kind of took Jaime's
         spot in like the head.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I knew everything that was going to
         happen until about Season Four. And was perfectly happy with it, really wasn't
         paying any attention.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually liked
         Sandor Clegane, Sansa Stark as a pairing, whether it's through platonic, whether
         it's romantic, et cetera. It was just one of those good ones. I thought they had
         good scene chemistry together. I always thought he kind of saw her,
         especially in the beginning as, he called her a little bird. Like, "I see that your
         parents never prepared you for this. Your best safe kept in a cage locked away, and
         you
         can just sing to people." I always liked that about him.</li>

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
         I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
         already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
         weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
         there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
         feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political
         institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family
         institutions. My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community
         college is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of
         people that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't
         talk about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
         that was the only source of information.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So then I realized that Jodhaa Akbar, which is
         definitely a Desi film, had a wonderful set of characters that was definitely
         angsty, but had a wonderfully happy ending. And allowed me to write about something
         that was kind of dear to my heart as well. Because it was a Desi film. It was one
         representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
         those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
         to bridge them. Because you have to. Because it's not just
         about love, or it's not just about anything. It's about your pride, it's about your
         family's livelihood. All of those kind of come together, you have to do it. You
         don't want to, but, somehow, you have to. I think it's that gritting of your teeth,
         and getting on with life that kind of really draws me in.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean that I just don't think I relate to him at the
         same extent that I relate to Sansa.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
         very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
         queer
         characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
         go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
         their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
         situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
         seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
         once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
         not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
         the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
         there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
         </li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
         it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
         since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
         until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
         a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
         decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
         this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
         case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
         Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
         bit.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
         was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
         possible love interests.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
         watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
         because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
         and so on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And because I grew up in a country
         where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian content was part of our
         regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened, so it shaped what I was
         interested in.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I
         think with Twilight it was just that phase where you finally find a
         story that speaks to you, even if you kind of hate it when you look back at it when
         you're older. But at the time, how
         Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
         small community and so forth and deals with depression or
         whatever it is, it just seemed to be something that I could relate to. And so
         I was both interested in that, and I guess in the power fantasy that she was written
         to
         come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
         characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it was more
         that it was very books for me because I grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on
         South America but as socially, politically part of the Caribbean, so most of the
         content that we were consuming was either shows from the US or whatever, maybe
         European shows might have filtered through, and that also was the case for the
         books that we were reading. And while it was the case within school for us to
         consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to read Caribbean literature as a
         person on my own.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So it was just discovering a collection of books in my
         own home from my aunt and my mother and so on, their teachers. And my aunt in particular,
         she
         teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
         them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
         were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
         know. I guess it comes back to not knowing what you're missing
         until you finally have it. So when I first read texts were people
         were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living
         in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et
         cetera.
         Because even though I speak, let's say,
         like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
         home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
         speak English, but it's a particular kind of English. So just
         seeing that in text and then realizing that the fantasies and so on that I was
         consuming were ... I don't know, it had these strange things that just didn't quite
         compute with where I was living. That's where it really clicked for me. And from
         that point onward, I think that's where I began to see it in everything else. The
         biggest shift didn't really come until I moved to the US, because back home I was
         part of the
         majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing yourself in other
         ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in the news as a
         politician, et cetera. But here it was a completely different
         ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't know, it just ... There may have been
         other works of fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that
         was when Korra just seemed more human.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>You actually get to see an
         avatar. And yes, Aang did deal with this too, but it's ... I don't know.
         It's just different for me.
         Deal with PTSD and depression and just all these changing
         things. It was interesting.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>everyone has seen someone who they think is
         all-powerful and infallible, invulnerable to an extent, be ... I don't want to say
         broken, but be injured in a
         really drastic way and them not being able to do anything much to help with her
         recovery in concrete ways.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I'm
         like, "In what world am I supposed to view this as platonic? I mean, I know I was
         raised
         in a pretty fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing
         here things that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
         00:58:53] people." So that's when I became a
         believer. And the longer I watched the show, the more it seemed to grow.</li>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
         have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
         in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
         very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
         you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
         original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
         through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
         and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
         with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
         get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
         you.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
         I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
         already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
         weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
         a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
         different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
         in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
         and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
         looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think if you look at A Song of Ice and Fire, technically,
         more than Game of Thrones, you
         actually get more of a cultural tension due to just the difference between the
         North and the South. And all of that. And I do think that George R. R. Martin
         has kind of perpetuated the idea, simply because he is English. So, the whole
         idea that in England, where Northerners are tougher and everything than
         Southerners. And I don't know anything more about it. But I think that's kind of
         one of the underlying and unconscious biases within the framework of the
         canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, obviously, Season Eight was terrible.
         That was a given. And the ending did not do anyone any favors.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And second of all, the actual TV show was not doing itself any
         favors. </li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I actually do remember how unhappy people were that Sansa didn't
         end with a love interest at the end of Season Eight.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, obviously, there's a ton of other problems. How [inaudible
         01:21:42] Daenerys, and Cersei, and Jaime. And a number of other characters.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I could understand why people felt unhappy about it. But at the same time, I
         think you're beating on the wrong bush here. There's a lot of other problems to deal
         with within this fandom. And within this canon that we don't particularly need as
         much as you're putting into it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
         don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
         came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
         into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
         ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
         super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
         of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
         relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
         should take five steps back, and let's just
         focus on these two.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think
         in the first two books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I
         guess her experiences are fantastical in a sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korra gets to her lowest point.  The implication is that she's about to jump off a
         cliff. But
         we don't really get to dwell in the true feeling of that moment, the have to fix
         it immediately because of the idea that the show may never get to come back to
         this point, so we don't get to actually see what that means for
         her.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think
         it's just existing personally as a marginalized person. The way that that storyline
         was handled in LOK, I think I wasn't quite comfortable with it, just the very idea
         of the movement disappearing because of one man's end. It seems so unrealistic
         because there was a real situation with inequality there. Because we see that the
         world has adapted to cater for benders, and we don't quite know non-benders are
         faring in that world, what kind of opportunities they're having. And based on the
         conflict that the show raised, it was clear that non-benders were in a position
         where they weren't having ends meet or they weren't getting the jobs that they hoped
         to get.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
         interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
         we
         kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
         thing about fandom
         and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
         either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
         enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
         in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
         world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
         through.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And
         you could tell, from a fandom perspective, some people who are cishet won't be able
         to speak to
         this, but you could tell that the writer's room was split in
         how they were portraying the characters because I think they got uncomfortable with
         how fandom
         was growing so rapidly and intensely around these two
         characters, even
         to the point where they used the black character as a wedge between
         them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
         in that show. </li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But we basically had these two
         actors leaning into it because they didn't have a problem with
         it, but we see that some of the writers were
         uncomfortable, or I guess maybe the network or the showrunners were
         uncomfortable where the story was heading. And so they moved
         away from what was organically developing to the extent where they took two
         characters who never said more than a single word to each other, and one of these
         characters actively disliked the other character, and said, "Hey, we're going to
         have these two put together. And we are
         going to have your favorite superhero be shipped with a slave
         owner. So, yay, have fun with that."</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So
         when you start off with a show that has ... It's basically girl-next-door, blonde,
         blue-eyed, sort of
         hyper-feminine in some ways but also gender non-conforming in other ways super
         hero dating a
         black man, or having that black man being put as a love interest when that's
         usually not the case, especially for that kind of media.
         And then you break them apart in the
         second season and conveniently replace him with a white man who just actually
         makes the character feel terrible and derails her show, and starts to get almost as
         much screen
         time as she does even though he's not really an integral part of the show. Just
         so much went wrong so fast. He was so bad.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>as like a side note, I think the show really undercut Jaime and Brienne's
         relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
         kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her. I was
         like, "Boy is a head shorter than her."</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I mean, personally, I think the whole bit where he leaves and comes
         back is bullshit. Like, I'm sorry, I can't even mince words with that</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That would have been a good way to end it, not, we're going to hug
         each other and we're going to let some rocks fall.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
         Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
         Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
         no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
         brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
         thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
         wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
         series, the first one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
         think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
         little bit of character assassination.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong> So seeing that, and kind of juxtaposing it against the Sansa
         we were getting in the show was a little irksome.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I literally got up off the couch and walked away when
         she got beheaded. I was very upset. It pissed me
         off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
         slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
         did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
         white women. That was very, very frustrating and irritating to
         me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That seemed completely out of
         character for me. The whole scene was out of character for me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
         of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
         That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I adore the Dorne
         storyline in the books, and they completely butchered it in the show. So, that's why
         I
         was like, no Dorne's way smarter than this. So yes, he's going to be the Dorne that
         you
         get in the books.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
         that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
         better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
         they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
         would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23].</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
         dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
         that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
         Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
         beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
         thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
         and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
         stalker-y.</li>

   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>"I can't really write this story about two women in love because one of them isn't
         a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall,</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
         about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
         those two pieces meld at the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love feeling represented."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about is to write about... Not
         just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia, not just homophobia,
         but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because this was the thing
         that was radicalizing me</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Asami plays that role, being a person to whom Korra wants to relate, is thrilled to
         relate, is not scared, or she is a little bit scared to relate, but is she scared
         to relate in the way that she's scared to relate to other people.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy understanding of
         the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a woman can love another
         woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows. This is nothing like,
         Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that institution itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
         a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
         but it's good.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And there's a degree to which it a queer reading, there's this political tendency
         to look at fiction and say, "I am going to tell the story you didn't."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
         love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
         stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
         of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
         of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
         "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
         who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
         of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that people writing about suffering and happiness, a lot of things happen
         in love stories in general, particularly in WlW and MlM stuff.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was laughing at the bottom set for heiress in the middle column, "a-asami" there.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>It's very interesting to me, because I think if you look at any other major
         fandom, you would probably get male male slash at a much higher rate than you're
         getting here.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> at least all three are those are canonically queer
         characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
         go,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And maybe, I think,
         during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
         different attitudes in that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>just
         seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
         once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
         not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
         the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
         there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>let's just
         focus on these two.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>As soon as Asami showed up on the screen, I must have lost
         it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
         happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so I really like reading things that are just
         soft and maybe things aren't so terrible for them where they are, and just sort
         of getting lost in the idea of, they can just relax. They've been through so
         much, they deserve a little bit of something that's not going to hurt them, with
         somebody who definitely wants the same for them, who wants the same for
         themselves.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I liked that they
         weren't immediate, for the most part.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>but they were so good together that I wanted to be able to
         sometimes just say they can be immediate,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
         it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
         since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
         until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
         a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
         decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
         this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
         case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
         Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
         bit.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, again, it was the prompts, but it was
         also, I have personally been a little conflicted on gender for a while, and it's
         like my sexuality, it was something that I sort of just say, "Well, I'll get to
         that when I have the chance."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>she's living the life that she wanted to live with a person she loves, doing
         something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
         complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
         obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
         that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
         most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
         see what they're going through and you see how their lives are</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
         care whether or not they necessarily gel."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"That's a little gayer than it maybe should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
         of people took that and decided to go with it</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>or at least Korrasami fans, picking
         up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
         so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
         happen."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>This is canon, right? This is canon. That's what this looks
         like</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>especially since, up to that point, there really hadn't been
         a whole lot of huge representation for female ships.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> Given my own cultural background and
         the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
         that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I wasn't
         quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
         to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
         community.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I just, spending so much time reading so much fanfiction
         from LOK and then branching out into Steven Universe and moving
         from Steven Universe into Supergirl, there was
         just more of an interaction with another side of fandom, the slash side of
         fandom. I don't know. I think you have to be integrated with others who are
         looking for more than what's presented, looking for more than what's norm,
         what's the acceptable way of telling a story of any kind of relationship really.
         </li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I was like, "Okay. This is pretty blatant. I
         don't see how anyone is not seeing this."</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I mean, I know I was raised
         in a pretty fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing
         here things that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
         00:58:53] people."</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>some people who are cishet won't be able to speak to
         this</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>two
         actors leaning into it because they didn't have a problem with
         it</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
         to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
         bi-sexual.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I was putting them on paper, using another
         character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
         where I felt I was kind of safe to do so.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
         show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
         just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
         not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
         female-female relationships as well</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was around the
         time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I sort of delved into this idea trying to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
         with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
         wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive shoulder for Jaime
         who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
         well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>my own experiences, just exploring the LGBT
         community in my area</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I really wanted
         to address the gender issue and the gender questioning and write how the
         experiences hit the hardest for me when I was thinking about
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>if you're very new into
         like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
         a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
         higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
         or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
         You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
         anything.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
         wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
         their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
         that would fit them better or explore better.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
         of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
         having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
         leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
         little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of write it as like a self-fulfilling
         fantasy as well as like how I would have pictured them actually going through
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>knowing that I could go back and explore myself with fan
         fic if I needed to as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
         them</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Renly/Lauris,
         obviously.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>We just did that, like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
         and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
         interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
         dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
         front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
         interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
         not try and put this away.</li>

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>if you read this you'll see homophobia. I can't not publish a story about homophobia.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about is to write about... Not
         just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia, not just homophobia,
         but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because this was the thing
         that was radicalizing me</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I remember being like, "Oh, these folks are not going to tell a child about queer
         sexuality." Particularly sexuality is a hard topic, you grow up in that kind of compound
         in a world where queer identities are looked down on, you're going to come away with
         this very strange view about that. And you might just be told nothing.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community college
         is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of people
         that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't talk
         about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
         that was the only source of information.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water
         Tribe, or is not criminalized anymore.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>turns out the book I was reading at the time that claimed that knowing someone who
         was gay had a significant...Or not knowing someone who was gay, but engaging with
         someone who's gay on the topic of being gay helped significantly with changing someone's
         political views, or being willing to accept gay people. Turns out that one was actually
         wrong, like literally the person who put together that study cooked the book.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> was thinking about New York City around the times of the Stonewall Riots. This is
         where those politics come in. I was playing with, what does it mean... I was playing
         with, what's particularly violent political oppression? What are the limits of political
         oppression in a relatively liberal cosmopolitan society?</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And maybe, I think,
         during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
         different attitudes in that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>A lot of
         straight people I know will look at a lot of these relationships and say, "Oh,
         that came from nowhere."</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it
         just seemed like the safer option at the time. </li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korrasami just seems too weird,
         okay people.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think they got uncomfortable with how fandom
         was growing so rapidly and intensely around these two
         characters</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>but we see that some of the writers were
         uncomfortable, or I guess maybe the network or the showrunners were
         uncomfortable where the story was heading.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>gender fluid and gender
         related things, it wasn't really there.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
         guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
         to when I came out to them.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
         don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
         just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
         literally right here.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Again, it's Renly/Lauris,
         Sansa/Marjory. Yeah, there's not a lot really on there.</li>

   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>"I can't really write this story about two women in love because one of them isn't
         a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>"This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy that there's not homophobia in a world
         with gender in the like weird way that... In ways that still reflect our I think gender
         and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the way that we have a sense of gender. Big,
         capital G Gender. And so I thought like, "What does it mean to have culture in the
         context of... What does it mean to be a cosmopolitan city where... There's both a
         degree of marginalization for like the Northern Water Tribe closing... Not so much
         that rules that are really intended to enforce gender norms are going to be there.
         And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a different understanding of gender in
         context," yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I'm really interested in the fact that Korra and Mako becomes more common after Korrasami
         happened.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>you're seeing is a movement from seeing the word girlfriend in a context of a text
         that's about a set of texts about relationships in a more heterosexual perspective,
         in a story about women. Because it looks to me that this is a story that, if you see
         jealous there, that looks like I'm looking at a piece that's from Korra's point of
         view. But then if I'm looking at boyfriend, I'm also thinking about Korra and Mako.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>just looking at masculinity as almost sexual in the middle there, an almost dangerous.
         Because a person's understanding of masculinity are sexual, like the second one is
         a kind of dangerous, like a kind of danger</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Versus like the sexuality in the second one, for feminine as well as that same panel,
         but it's not like dangerous</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it's just very interesting to me to
         see how female male has been so prevalent across all seasons. And to such an
         extent. And, I mean, obviously, there are a lot of theories about why that
         is</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
         I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
         make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
         heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
         fandoms.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
         super forced</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Initially, it was definitely harder to see
         that</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>the easy answer is sexism,
         because everyone sees the main heroine next to a cute boy and decides, "That's
         good. I'm going to do that," without maybe necessarily putting much more thought
         into it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>A lot of
         straight people I know will look at a lot of these relationships and say, "Oh,
         that came from nowhere."</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>it was kind of taboo for
         divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
         portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
         it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I wasn't
         quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
         to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
         community.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>She's not a dainty fainting
         flower that they love.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> At the time, I don't know, it was just that Korra
         and Mako were what was the norm. And so I think it made sense for some people to
         only be able to see that happening. I mean, I didn't see the possibility of
         Korrasami until the very end.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Plus the allocishets tend to dominate
         fandom in general, so it made sense that they would sort of own the sandbox and
         everyone else should be playing to the side.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>couldn't quite bring
         themselves to see what others were seeing when they took the allocishet glasses
         off.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I'm always on the fence sometimes when I'm talking
         about how people are seeing or not seeing certain things. Because even with my
         current fandom, it's like half the people are saying that we're delusional or
         creating things where there aren't things. And then other times you see these
         exact phenomena occurring in cishet media.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>because a lot of the media already does a lot of
         the male-female exploration.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong> lot of their fics also had a lot of like Jaime
         being the man and Brienne finally being able to let her guard
         down.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>it was all
         very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
         vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It went
         into his relationship with his father, he was caught walking in his mother's red
         heels and he got very scolded and punished for it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I do understand the whole
         like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
         romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
         just write a Nora Roberts novel."</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Most Game of Thrones fanfic is incredibly hetero
         normative </li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Again, it's Renly/Lauris,
         Sansa/Marjory. Yeah, there's not a lot really on there.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
         less fanfic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
         unique friendship/relationship</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>the show really undercut Jaime and Brienne's
         relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
         kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong> lot of
         the fics, even with Jaime and Brienne is just depressingly, like, "Wow, if I
         wanted to read this fic, I'd just go to like any romance section and find
         it."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>wonderful knights in their shining armor, these
         lovely ladies who are just ethereal in their beauty, everything being wrapped up
         in a bow, happily ever after. Maybe something happens, but someone's always
         rescued.</li>

   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I remember coming away with this feeling that there is a marginalized subjectivity
         in the Northern Water Tribe. And so telling this story about difference in culture</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Basically that I think Korra's upbringing is particularly reflective of that culture,
         yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>"This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy that there's not homophobia in a world
         with gender in the like weird way that... In ways that still reflect our I think gender
         and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the way that we have a sense of gender. Big,
         capital G Gender. And so I thought like, "What does it mean to have culture in the
         context of... What does it mean to be a cosmopolitan city where... There's both a
         degree of marginalization for like the Northern Water Tribe closing... Not so much
         that rules that are really intended to enforce gender norms are going to be there.
         And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a different understanding of gender in
         context," yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
         progressive father.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy understanding of
         the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a woman can love another
         woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows. This is nothing like,
         Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that institution itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because it was a Desi film. It was one
         representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
         those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
         to bridge them.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, you need to have that religious, and
         cultural, and those barriers in order for that to
         happen.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, of course, you have the Targaryen
         colors, which are black, which are mourning colors according to the Western
         culture. </li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Where I
         just didn't translate them into Rajput or Hindi words. Because I just use
         whatever I knew, because I speak Kannada at home.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well as
         South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
         Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because it's also your
         culture. You know what you're doing, you know where you're coming from. But we
         would not do it." And, I mean, the vast majority of them were from the U.K. or
         the U.S., and they were not from the same culture.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I was also combining both South Indian and North Indian tropes, to a
         certain extent. And those weren't necessarily very compatible. And there's a lot
         of history behind that and everything.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because especially when you're looking at a lot of Indian mothers, and Indian
         women who get into marriages at a very young age. You have to deal with your
         husband's family, you have to deal with that entire kind of stigma. About you
         have to be the one to adjust and to compromise to a far greater extent than your
         husband.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Where she was
         just trying to fight it, she was such a perfect child in that culture. And then
         suddenly she has to kind of leave her culture behind. Or, not leave her culture
         behind, but adjust to a new culture.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>you
         actually get more of a cultural tension due to just the difference between the
         North and the South. And all of that. And I do think that George R. R. Martin
         has kind of perpetuated the idea, simply because he is English. So, the whole
         idea that in England, where Northerners are tougher and everything than
         Southerners. And I don't know anything more about it. But I think that's kind of
         one of the underlying and unconscious biases within the framework of the
         canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Especially that religious tension between Jon and
         Sansa. And have that difference, where both of them and neither of them are
         willing to compromise on that.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I mean, there are
         cultural differences within, I mean, people that I've grown up with in India,
         and people in the U.S. And even though you're living side by side, that doesn't
         necessarily mean that you have the same cultural background.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, I mean, we don't know if she relies more on
         her religion because she left her homeland, and came to the North. And just
         wanted some desperate way, something to rely on that's her family, or that
         reminded her of home. But to me, at least, I can imagine, especially the actual
         Jodhaa, going to Akbar's Islamic court. And basically being all alone, and not
         having very many allies. And finding some sort of a solace in her religion of
         Hinduism.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because as much as she's giving him the gift,
         she's also giving him his name. And she's stepping across her own cultural
         boundaries to help him with that, which Jon doesn't completely
         understand.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong> And adjusting to that
         is a huge, almost, culture shock to people.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And has to go to a foreign country without any
         support, and any of her own traditions. She's the one that's upheld every single
         tradition she has ever done. And especially when you're looking at the Hindu
         culture, it's very difficult to uphold them.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
         watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
         because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
         and so on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I got into forums and fans would
         translate for those of us who didn't speak Hindi.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>it was kind of taboo for
         divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
         portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
         it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I grew up in a country
         where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian content was part of our
         regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened, so it shaped what I was
         interested in.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on
         South America but as socially, politically part of the Caribbean, so most of the
         content that we were consuming was either shows from the US or whatever, maybe
         European shows might have filtered through, and that also was the case for the
         books that we were reading. And while it was the case within school for us to
         consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to read Caribbean literature as a
         person on my own.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And my aunt in particular, she
         teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
         them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
         were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
         know. </li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So when I first read texts were people
         were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living
         in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et
         cetera.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because even though I speak, let's say,
         like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
         home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
         speak English, but it's a particular kind of English.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>because back home I was part of the
         majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing yourself in other
         ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in the news as a
         politician, et cetera</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But here it was a completely different
         ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> Given my own cultural background and
         the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
         that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I mean, I know I was raised
         in a pretty fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing
         here things that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
         00:58:53] people."</li>

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Given this is a proportion, I don't know if [inaudible 00:57:24] but more people as
         a fandom and those few people aren't interested in talking about race in ways that
         people who had been there before were, and those people who were there before continued
         to talk about race, or if there is an effectively gentrifying mmoment that a white
         fandom comes in, pushes out a fandom of color.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
         be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
         Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on
         South America but as socially, politically part of the Caribbean, so most of the

      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But here it was a completely different
         ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because even when
         you talk about what characters are bound to get more attention and more
         interesting and so on and so forth, when you look at fandom in general you'll
         find that when those characters are black or just generally a person of color in
         comparison to a character being white, that people are least particular when the
         fandom's dominated by white faces and so forth. They are more likely to explore
         those characters and to humanize them and to want to get to know them better,
         while other characters and what their hopes and dreams and ideas might be for
         the world are pushed to the side.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>even
         to the point where they used the black character as a wedge between
         them</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And we are
         going to have your favorite superhero be shipped with a slave
         owner.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And then you break them apart in the
         second season and conveniently replace him with a white man who just actually
         makes the character feel terrible</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It pissed me
         off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
         slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
         did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
         white women.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Mostly she seems to almost
         be absent from things. She's window dressing. She's there, she doesn't speak, or she
         speaks, it's one or two sentences in the entire fic.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>you get those fics where she
         either has none of those, she's either not there, or she has really none of those
         attributes. She's kind of just a yes person. Yes, Khaleesi, no Khaleesi, yes my
         queen.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because there aren't really a lot of
         fics that focus on her as a character at all.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
         seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
         woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
         anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
         back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
         Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
         slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
         she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
         jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
         great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
         I've seen it before.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>No, you
         would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
         think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
         better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
         are not. You are exactly like them</li>

      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Because I just find keeping people as slaves is super ... I didn't want to
         contribute to it</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>good that
         nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
         communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
         white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
         frankly.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So when I first read texts were people
         were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living

      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>both as a black person and as a woman, it was
         just important for me to recognize that in text and get around to exploring what
         that might have meant for other characters who weren't within the Circle of the
         Avatar and had powerful connections.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> dating a
         black man, or having that black man being put as a love interest when that's
         usually not the case, especially for that kind of media.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
         away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
         one thing that would be important to her?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't know if I was a former slave. The one thing I
         would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
         in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
         into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
         anymore.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
         better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
         they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
         would.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>she believes in a world
         without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
         something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
         times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
         I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
         to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
         think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
         sentiment.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
         be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
         be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And for her of course it's more extreme,
         from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
         decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
         getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
         found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
         myself.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>it
         was talking about how former slaves, they go through this process of not believing
         that they're free, and not believing that they're free, and not believing that
         they're free. And eventually, they get to a
         point where it sticks in their head, that this is freedom. This is what they
         have. No one can control them. And then, they get very, very almost violently
         independent, where no one's going to tell me what to do. You can't tell me what
         to do. No one's going to do that to me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>They get this burst of a sense of self, a
         sense of purpose. And I thought that was very beautiful, that there are people
         who can go through all that type of trauma, and they can get there, and they can
         fully bloom. And I always saw Missandei as kind of that character, this
         character who had gone through all of that to the point where here she is,
         standing tall as a character that knows her own worth, knows her own
         personage.</li>

      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>the easy answer is sexism,
         because everyone sees the main heroine next to a cute boy and decides, "That's
         good. I'm going to do that," without maybe necessarily putting much more thought
         into it.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But even Katara in the beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use
         waterbending beyond healing</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> derails her show, and starts to get almost as much screen
         time as she does even though he's not really an integral part of the show. Just
         so much went wrong so fast. He was so bad.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>But there would definitely be some push
         back,</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think that reflected a lot of her issues with not being able
         to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
         heir, giving him a son and all these things.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Residual toxic masculinity and
         all of that.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>the show really undercut Jaime and Brienne's
         relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
         kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I always thought he kind of saw her,
         especially in the beginning as, he called her a little bird. Like, "I see that your
         parents never prepared you for this. Your best safe kept in a cage locked away, and
         you
         can just sing to people."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
         and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
         stalker-y.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Petyr would relish that. He
         does everything he can to get her into trusting him, and thinking of him as her
         friend, and I would do anything for you, and that's really, really creepy. It's
         always a surprise to me when I see Petyr Baelish, Sansa Stark fics especially
         ones where it's not manipulative, and coercive, and creepy, I'm like, "What are
         you guys seeing in that?" That's just odd.</li>

   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
         love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
         stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
         of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
         of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
         "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
         who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
         of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>To any women, adjusting to that is
         difficult.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Which is, "Yes, I'm miserable. I want you to be miserable. But how am I going
         to be miserable for?" You need to let some things go, you need to move on past
         the injustices... I need to move past the injustices that I have
         faced.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Or, she's feeling as if her family is not willing to give
         her as much as she is owed when she's going into a
         marriage.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>when I was first getting into the fandom,
         one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
         strong.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Like, you have Sansa, who
         is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
         of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
         conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
         world.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
         child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
         sure that nobody hurt her.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think
         there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
         liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
         everything.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>that they have
         very female-centered stories.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> And for Korra, she's an imposing
         figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>it was kind of taboo for
         divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
         portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
         it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess in the power fantasy that she was written to
         come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
         characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>both as a black person and as a woman, it was
         just important for me to recognize that in text and get around to exploring what
         that might have meant for other characters who weren't within the Circle of the
         Avatar and had powerful connections.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular,
         I think it's fascinating that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all
         these really powerful girl and women characters who were, for the most part,
         respected, at least in later years.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So it was
         interesting to see all these female characters get to be complex and powerful
         and not have that held against them,</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>we have Korra, who is the avatar, and she is this
         figure who is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity
         that we're accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants
         without concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think
         about her gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering
         herself inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this
         particular form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin
         and we see Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or
         they're dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with
         their mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well,
         if they do have children, and so forth.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korra is an avatar who's a
         woman.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's basically girl-next-door, blonde, blue-eyed, sort of
         hyper-feminine in some ways but also gender non-conforming in other ways super
         hero</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>obviously they wouldn't be having as
         much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
         considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
         day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
         from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
         versa.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I made her a little bit more comfortable in
         her skin than Jaime</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
         own instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>he always had a very strange affinity, but
         like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
         loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
         of view.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Jaime had this big, beautiful wife that was taller than him
         and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
         wonderful?"</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>willing to not listen to him, who
         understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
         manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
         only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
         run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
         ends are."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>that's my choice. But it won't be going back
         to a ruined Winterfell to marry a legitimized bastard.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>he would never allow that, because he
         wants control of her, and that is something that she realizes, because she's not
         an idiot.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's re-discovered her strength. She's
         done something that she didn't think she could do.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was kind of that whole, what that
         episode was about was Sansa really re-discovering herself, and what she could
         do.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So really, Sansa's really forced to grow up,
         and she's really forced to see all these stories as exactly what they are.
         They're just stories.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>What I was afraid of, I should never have
         been afraid of, what I wanted was the thing I should have been worried about.
         She's really kind of flipped the script in her own mind.</li>

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
         and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
         said that at the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois radical is that I'm not going
         to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really have a sense of class politics
         at the time, or have the beginnings of that study</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>growing up with the rich father,
         she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
         life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
         all the time.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She was definitely never really prepared for court
         life.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
         seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
         woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
         anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
         back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
         Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
         slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
         she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
         jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
         great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
         I've seen it before.</li>

         think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're

         are not. You are exactly like them</li>

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It's a piece about about trauma... And it [inaudible 00:05:20], that this isn't obviously.
         It's a piece about trauma and it's a piece about, what does it mean... Really they're
         both pieces about what it means to be disabled.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just very surface, very basic understanding
         of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something you recover from, in a way that I
         was not super comfortable with. And sort of the original text, not sure if you would
         agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability through the context of being something
         you come to live with, and come to integrate, and come to find becomes a part of you
         life, but also something you still struggle with, instead of just, I don't know, a
         lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you get better, and then you get better
         and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother you.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it, as a writer.
         I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's beneficial
         or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it now, but
         I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy. I know
         I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized, and
         I didn't say that obviously in the tags.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
         I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
         already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
         weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
         about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
         those two pieces meld at the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because
         I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wasn't telling you things that had happened in the past, to teach you what happened
         in the past. I was saying, "This is what's haunting the characters, this is what the
         characters can't escape from in a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical
         might be the wrong word, you know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes
         sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was trying to write a story that engaged with trauma and felt authentic and didn't
         make trauma seem like the end of the world. Because the binary that's in a lot of
         literature is either like, "Oh, you either overcame trauma, or you are doomed to misery
         forever." And I was trying to find some middle ground, trying to tell a story that
         felt authentic.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
         her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
         Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
         is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
         dress herself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>it's not really about romance as much as it is about feeling connected in a genuine
         way to people, that that central theme, building a life worth living after injury,
         or after trauma, is finding an authentic realtionship with people.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>because Korra's definitely, she's
         traumatized.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>she's trying to have a good experience and maybe power
         through it, but then, in that brief lapse where she forgets that she's tied down
         and then she tries to sit up, it's sort of like a muscle memory thing, where
         she's back there the last time she was chained up and couldn't
         move.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
         Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
         small community and so forth and deals with depression</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>we get to see Korra, who is
         this all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having
         this really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once
         had, and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to
         deal with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so
         forth.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's just different for me.
         Deal with PTSD and depression and just all these changing
         things.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't want to say broken, but be injured in a
         really drastic way and them not being able to do anything much to help with her
         recovery in concrete ways.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>to be someone who builds and creates
         with the purpose of fixing or making better, but then not being able to do so for
         someone within your personal life.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>when I was writing, I wasn't very well-versed in
         not just having a limb missing as a disability, but also how advanced the
         prosthetics were and if they could hold things</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I would definitely
         want to go more into his disability as well as his prosthetic and how it worked
         more.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually had to do a bit of
         research on some of the fic, for things like trauma, and how people respond to
         trauma. Especially in the case of Sansa and Missandei, how do people overcome
         certain difficulties after being in these different positions?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, mostly
         it was Googling, recovering from trauma. I did a little bit of research on former
         slaves, to see their mindset.</li>

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I guess it was actually about immigration, it's just I never really ever got around

         up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>You could do what, when and where, the idea that a politician can't really save the
         world. I don't know if I was all the way to, "We have to do it," yet, but I think
         I'm getting there.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This was written obviously before Donald Trump becomes President, and I could see
         all sorts of things about reaction again. But I was seeing the reaction, I was scared.
         I don't know where I got this, there was something bad was coming. I knew that I had
         that sense of fear, so I was writing about... I guess writing a little bit about,
         how do we fight back when things get worse?</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I'd write it as a story that talks about immigration, and talks about sweeping panic
         and fear that spill off of that. I'd probably talk about gender through those lenses,
         and I'd probably talk about humanity in a slightly more complex... I'd probably make
         it a story that... I'd probably both use modern messages to say that, I'd probably
         talk more about police state, and police state as endless spying networks where you
         don't know when you're being spied on and when you're not, and endless police states</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> so much MlM stuff is kind of uncomfortable? A lot it's very clearly written by women.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't really understand ABO [alpha, beta, omega] as in general, so I can't talk.
         They're not as inherently sexual. They definitely struck me as relatively sexual</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong> But it was, I
         think, mostly due to the kind of deep rage that I was feeling over the entire
         Democratic Primaries over the past couple of months. And almost the past year.
         In which everything felt very much like a lot of talk, and not a lot of doing.
         And at some point, you need some catharsis. And kind of putting it out into
         fiction and seeing something changing. Or, not even seeing something changing.
         But seeing people trying to effect change, and willing to fight for that change
         felt very important to me. And basically that entire fanfic is kind of born out
         of that seething, massive, "I want to see something happening."</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>From either my own culture because, of course,
         this is partially my own culture.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
         that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
         see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
         very difficult way of going through life.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>it's a common trope in a lot of fanfiction communities, is the student-teacher
         ... What is that? Student-teacher pairing, whatever. My dad is a teacher, so the
         idea of that has always just absolutely not been something that I want to
         encourage, and it just isn't good, so I don't like writing that, I don't like
         reading it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>You look out your window and things are just not
         good a lot of the time,</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>how these shows and books and games et cetera were failing us, whether it
         was in terms of the content or the representation or just releasing new things like
         thought arcs that weren't followed through on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because even though I speak, let's say,
         like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
         home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
         speak English, but it's a particular kind of English.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
         not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
         audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
         exploration. </li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
         guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
         for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
         act of violence ...</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I think that's my favorite thing about fandom
         and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
         either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
         enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
         in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
         world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
         through.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think,
         and I'll probably go with my own fandom experiences, it just comes back to how
         the world is constructed externally. So just even the idea of imagining inside
         of what was placed before us, it takes a special kind of familiarity with the
         boarders of the world to imagine a world that is different from what is
         presented to you.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>that people were so willing to see all these other,
         in some ways really twisted, relationship dynamics,</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>you don't really understand romance all
         typically well. It's all very idealized.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>it was one of
         the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
         pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
         surprised.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>A lot of incest. An exorbitant amount of
         incest, like beyond what I even take it. I'm typically very do what you want,
         but even now, I'm just like don't like that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>willing to not listen to him, who
         understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
         manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
         only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
         run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
         ends are."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>he would never allow that, because he
         wants control of her, and that is something that she realizes, because she's not
         an idiot.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
         seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
         woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
         anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
         back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
         Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
         slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
         she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
         jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
         great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
         I've seen it before.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
         that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
         be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
         be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually had to do a bit of
         research on some of the fic, for things like trauma, and how people respond to
         trauma. Especially in the case of Sansa and Missandei, how do people overcome
         certain difficulties after being in these different positions?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, mostly
         it was Googling, recovering from trauma. I did a little bit of research on former
         slaves, to see their mindset.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then with Sansa, just how people recover
         from abusive and traumatic relationships, and things like that. The stages of
         recovery.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually liked
         Sandor Clegane, Sansa Stark as a pairing, whether it's through platonic, whether
         it's romantic, et cetera.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
         and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
         stalker-y.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Sansa, Petyr, I've always hated that one, simply because he's grooming. It's
         very obvious.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Petyr would relish that. He
         does everything he can to get her into trusting him, and thinking of him as her
         friend, and I would do anything for you, and that's really, really creepy. It's
         always a surprise to me when I see Petyr Baelish, Sansa Stark fics especially
         ones where it's not manipulative, and coercive, and creepy, I'm like, "What are
         you guys seeing in that?" That's just odd.</li>
