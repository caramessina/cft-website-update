<h2>Fan Community Politics</h2>
    <ul>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But a few years later when I was, I think,
          13, my friend introduced me to like crack Lord Of The Rings fiction. I had a very
          close group of friends on Live Journal back
          in the early 2000s. That, I think, probably because I was a teenager. Perhaps this
          is because of all those reasons. But that kind of close-knittedness has never kind
          of shown up for me ever since. I think I tend to participate now on more, "Oh, this
          is really interesting for me. And this is really fascinating." And I'll go into it
          for the material as opposed to the friendships themselves. Mostly to keep
          myself writing. Because, otherwise, I would just not publish those materials until
          it becomes, you know. It's basically sitting on my hard drive for years and years
          on
          end, and finally I get the opportunity and the motivation to publish them. Because,
          initially, it was definitely a very close-knit, just writing for friends and with
          friends.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that for
          the actual research it was not so much that I did it for this particular fanfic, as
          it was more that I love that era a lot. So, I had tended to research it before, as
          well. So, I had a lot of information that I kind of knew in colloquial terms. But
          I did
          not remember the exact way that he had died, so then I kind of went searching for
          that. And then, I mean, from there it kind of spiraled into researching other things
          and kind of reading up more about Akbar and more about Jodhaa. And I'm an avid
          research. I mean, that's what I do now. And then, of course, you have the Targaryen
          colors, which are black, which are mourning colors according to the Western
          culture. And all of it kind of comes together. And, of course,
          Rajput culture is known for its red, its vibrant, blood red. And obviously, that's
          a
          Targaryen color. And all of this kind of, to me, I mean, I think that's what
          a lot of fanficiton is, at least. It's taking things that are already there and kind
          of pooling them together. And sometimes you have amazing coincidences that people
          just don't think about. And it's about exploiting those coincidences, and making
          them sound like, "Oh, I'm so brilliant. I actually had thought about it
          beforehand." Where I
          just didn't translate them into Rajput or Hindi words. Because I just use
          whatever I knew, because I speak Kannada at home. And that's
          another language entirely. And I was just running out of time, and I said, "You know
          what? No, I'll just handle it myself. And not translate it, and hope that nobody
          minds. I think a lot of the research and a lot of the material
          was just about identifying and pulling disparate ideas together that I knew.
          From either my own culture because, of course,
          this is partially my own culture. And also, the historical
          details of [inaudible 00:27:49]. And I think that was what
          was very important to me, especially in this story, was puling it all together so
          that there weren't any open endings. And the research really, somehow, it helped in
          pulling that together.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I honestly expected nobody to do
          that. It's good to see that people are just as interested in a lot of it, in this
          stuff. You know? I think that the
          thing I wanted to keep in mind was that I was doing the research, but I was also not
          putting as much research into it as I probably should have if I wanted to make it
          historical fiction. I was literally
          just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
          as
          South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
          Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it. And that was one thing I
          wanted to be clear about.
          Because, yes, it was research. But I think I wanted to keep to the spirit of the
          movie, as well as the spirit of the A Song of Ice and Fire canon. But when I was making
          the
          actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
          actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
          identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
          identify. But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
          and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
          that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
          ideas from. Just building that list kind of helps me know where and how
          I'm getting the material, and the assumptions that I've made throughout the fanfic.
          And, therefore, helps make it easier to kind of discuss it later, I think. I was really
          worried about how it
          would be perceived by the fandom, how it would be received by people even outside
          of
          the fandom. Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
          be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner. So, that was one of the
          primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
          sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was
          really worried about it, actually. Because I spoke to a couple people before I
          published the fanfic. Because I was kind of worried about it, and I wasn't sure how
          it would be received. And my friends in the fandom were all like, "Okay, well,
          we trust you. Because it's also your
          culture. You know what you're doing, you know where you're coming from. But we
          would not do it." And, I mean, the vast majority of them were from the U.K. or
          the U.S., and they were not from the same culture. And they
          were like, "We would be very hesitant about it, but we trust you. If you know what
          you're doing, then go ahead and do it." But they were very supportive in that
          manner. But it wasn't a blanket support, as I was kind of hoping for, I should
          say. And I wasn't sure people would
          think that it was good enough. Because I was also combining both South Indian and
          North Indian tropes, to a
          certain extent. And those weren't necessarily very compatible. And there's a lot
          of history behind that and everything. And I wasn't entirely
          sure how people would perceive it. But people were very kind about it. And I haven't
          actually gotten a single negative feedback on that fanfic to date. And
          especially when she has that fight with Jon and she goes back home. And that was,
          I
          think, the point of catharsis. Because especially when you're looking at a lot of
          Indian mothers, and Indian
          women who get into marriages at a very young age. You have to deal with your
          husband's family, you have to deal with that entire kind of stigma. About you
          have to be the one to adjust and to compromise to a far greater extent than your
          husband. And all of these kind of had come together and had
          been marinating for a very long time. And I feel like Sansa, in this, was very much
          the product of that. Where she was
          just trying to fight it, she was such a perfect child in that culture. And then
          suddenly she has to kind of leave her culture behind. Or, not leave her culture
          behind, but adjust to a new culture. And she feels like she's
          being punished by her old one for no fault of her own. And all of it, kind of, her
          desperate unhappiness, her tensions with her mother were a big part of the fic, I
          think, for me.  And I was so
          worried. Because all of this was very close to my heart, and I did not want to have
          to deal with a lot of backlash, or feedback, or having to fight to say, "Well, I
          don't mean to be rude on any of these kinds of things." These are meant with respect
          and they're meant with love. And they're from a part of myself. So, with all of that
          in mind, the actual fandom
          response was absolutely wonderful, and absolutely, completely respectful. And none
          of my fears at all came to fruition. Because they were all so kind, and so respectful
          of the entire fic in
          general.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
          clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
          Jon is raised a Targaryen. And it is an angsty fic. It's not like a comedy, there
          is angst.
          And it's one of the major points of the entire fanfic. And the reason I did the Jodhaa
          Akbar tag was actually
          because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
          other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
          fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
          particular tag. I mean, this fic is obviously
          dramatized and all that. But the essential part of it is that both of them have
          this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
          that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
          see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
          very difficult way of going through life. And it's not
          necessarily a happy life that you lead when you have that kind of a
          mentality.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Oh. I think I learned that people are far more
          understanding than I was giving them credit for, especially because I was so afraid
          about the reception. But then, I also think that one of the major
          things that I learned was probably that some of the anger, it doesn't have to be a
          very you anger to be a very deep one. For it to seep into your writing. Because a
          lot of the time, especially when I'm writing angry stories and everything, they tend
          to be immediate. Like, "Okay, I'm very angry right now. And I want to have a fit.
          And I want to do it." But this was something that it had kind have been, I think,
          brewing for a very long time. And then suddenly the anger, and the angst, and the
          hurt, and the pain, all kind of came out. But at the same time, it was not just
          that. It was also about passing through that anger, and knowing that there is going
          to be someone at the end of it who's willing to accept you.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, obviously, Season Eight was terrible.
          That was a given. And the ending did not do anyone any favors. So, I could
          see how much the fandom had increased in size by the time Season Seven had came
          around. Because it was huge. There were a lot of people there, it had increased
          exponentially. And Season Eight made the fandom even bigger, honestly, in a certain
          way. But I also remember that there were a lot of fandom issues going on at the
          time, between people within the fandom and everything. But, second of all, the fandom
          itself,
          I think, had grown to such a point that it kind of imploded. I do remember that a
          lot of good authors, and a lot of people did leave the fandom at the time.
          Because, first of all, the fandom was
          terrible. And second of all, the actual TV show was not doing itself any
          favors. </li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>You can tell
          exactly what the fandom is focused on here.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I was actually
          looking at the most common gender pairings. It's very interesting to me, because I
          think if you look at any other major
          fandom, you would probably get male male slash at a much higher rate than you're
          getting here.
          And it's just very interesting to me to
          see how female male has been so prevalent across all seasons. And to such an
          extent. And, I mean, obviously, there are a lot of theories about why that
          is, and how that comes about, and all of that. But I think...
          Oh, wow. Wait. Hang on. I'm looking... There's Gen that's higher than male slash in
          Season Eight.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
          I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
          make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
          heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
          fandoms. And I think that's probably because we don't have one
          main character and one side character that's like the sidekick to the main
          character, both of them being male. You don't have that here.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I actually do remember how unhappy people were that Sansa didn't
          end with a love interest at the end of Season Eight.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I could understand why people felt unhappy about it. But at the same time, I
          think you're beating on the wrong bush here. There's a lot of other problems to deal
          with within this fandom. And within this canon that we don't particularly need as
          much as you're putting into it.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Tyrion is
          surprisingly popular to be honest. I didn't think that he'd be as... I knew he'd be
          popular as a character. But not a person on Archive of Our Own. I didn't think that
          AO3 people would write a lot about him.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I like that a lot of people, I still get comments
          occasionally that are, "I've just gone through this whole thing," and you can do
          that. Even though it's 400 chapters, it's book-length. It's like a
          normal book length. It's easily digestible, and each thing's its own thing, so if
          you want to stop it and come back to it later, you can. People do usually, if you're
          feeling a specific mood, and go find that specific one and just go through a couple
          of those. I like that it's sort of, you don't have to have a super amount of
          emotional investment in it, like super long, 10-chapter fics that are 100,000
          words. Like yes, it's very good. I enjoy it. But sometimes, I'm just in
          the mood for something light and I like that I can provide that for people who want
          that. I also like that you can sort of see a progression of
          how I wrote them and how my own skills have maybe, hopefully developed. And even
          just, it did end up being four years' worth of time so it was, when I think I started
          it, Korrasami hadn't
          been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
          And maybe, I think,
          during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
          different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
          strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, the fact that
          it was short meant that I did only have a certain amount of words to deal with
          it. So, if there were some things where I'd write the
          original drabble, and then I might get three more immediate requests in my inbox for
          a sequel, or for, "Can I get a full length thing of this?" And I didn't necessarily
          have the time or energy, or just the inclination in some cases. And sometimes, there
          were just
          prompts that were not necessarily things that I wanted to do or actively didn't want
          to do So, I would start to feel guilty, and sometimes
          would just push one out whether or not I felt it was up to par, even though I hoped
          it was.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> I
          know it's, I don't want to say a popular trope, but it's a common trope in a lot of
          fanfiction communities, is the student-teacher
          ... What is that? Student-teacher pairing, whatever. My dad is a teacher, so the
          idea of that has always just absolutely not been something that I want to
          encourage, and it just isn't good, so I don't like writing that, I don't like
          reading it. That's definitely one of the things. I'm sure
          there's been others, but that's always been a big one for me.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I'm
          very much a person who believes in, if you can't say it in like two words
          then you probably shouldn't. So, I like to have it, what
          is this thing? And that's it. I like to be able to say, "This is what it's going to
          be," and it doesn't necessarily need to be more complicated than that. I know a lot
          of people like to have full sentences, and
          get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
          distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
          be
          able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
          somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
          something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
          looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
          and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
          is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
          don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
          came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
          into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
          ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that. "Okay, well, let's just do Korra next,"
          because I was pretty sure
          that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
          of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
          of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
          watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it. I was very
          much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
          and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
          style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality. And
          then, just
          seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
          once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
          not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
          the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
          there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
          Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
          super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
          of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
          relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
          should take five steps back, and let's just
          focus on these two.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
          only get a certain amount of them in canon. So, it's kind of just how I always
          imagined her parents were just going to always be there for her. And we do see that
          in season three, where she's immediately going to bat for them and each
          other. So, at the same time,
          it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
          since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
          until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
          a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
          decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
          this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
          case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
          Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
          bit. So, I just tried to stay true to that, I guess, in some
          regard, as far as her relationship went.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, again, it was the prompts, but it was
          also, I have personally been a little conflicted on gender for a while, and it's
          like my sexuality, it was something that I sort of just say, "Well, I'll get to
          that when I have the chance." So, it's always just sort of in
          the back of my head I
          try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
          to live with a person she loves, doing
          something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
          complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
          obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
          yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
          be happy. And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
          that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
          most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
          see what they're going through and you see how their lives are,
          and I try not to speak for situations that I've never lived through, but you can
          draw knowledge from that and say, "Okay, well, without going in depth into feelings
          or things like that, I can add this, this, and this, and make it maybe relatable in
          that regard."</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
          serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
          just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
          things that made me super uncomfortable. And it's also, given the
          audience, this is considered a family show. So, I realized over time that maybe I
          don't have to write that. If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
          it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
          press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
          slaves is super ... I didn't want to
          contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
          [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
          more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
          been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
          thing.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So now,
          I sort of write when I want to, when I have the motivation. And if I'm feeling it,
          yeah, I'll do a little bit. Like somebody requested a prompt two weeks ago. I was
          like, "You know what? Why not. I'm feeling it. We're going to go for it." I learned
          to just not push it,
          don't write what other people are demanding, necessarily. And it's okay to learn from
          other writers. Like I said
          with coeurdastronaute, everything she writes is like, "I'm in
          love with this. It's great. How can I maybe write something similar to that? What
          parts can I take from this that I want to emulate?" Especially with the prompts and
          setting boundaries like you
          mentioned earlier. It's writing what you want. My audience should be myself, at the
          end of the day. I
          want to write the things that I want to read. Even if I'd much rather prefer just
          reading it and not having to put the time and effort into clacking my way through
          it, if I want to read it, I have to write it sometimes, which is fine. But I should
          enjoy the things that I'm writing. And it's okay that maybe only three other people
          also liked it, but I like it.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Oh,
          the easy answer is sexism,
          because everyone sees the main heroine next to a cute boy and decides, "That's
          good. I'm going to do that," without maybe necessarily putting much more thought
          into it. Obviously, there's always going to be people who say,
          "I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
          care whether or not they necessarily gel." I'm sure there's
          people ... I feel like I went back a million years ago and looked at the first
          Korrasami fics, just out of curiosity, to see when they were published, and I'm sure
          that they were like episode one, because it's just what people do, and it's great.
          Ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon. So, it was there,
          but
          it's not surprising that a lot of people who aren't looking for it don't go and see
          it. A lot of
          straight people I know will look at a lot of these relationships and say, "Oh,
          that came from nowhere."</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>At the end of season three, we saw that development and
          we saw, especially during Korra's fight with Zaheer, Asami looked the most scared
          out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her
          recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, "That's a little gayer than it maybe
          should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
          of people took that and decided to go with it, especially since
          the relationship was [inaudible 01:00:21], whether or not ...
          Again, and at that time, we didn't know the writer's intention, so it was just
          everybody, or at least Korrasami fans, picking
          up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
          so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
          happen."</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
          was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
          possible love interests. Tahno was just a bully that people decide ... I don't
          understand why people like that, but people do. So, we spend four seasons developing
          Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
          lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
          out  immediately after
          the season finale aired, everyone was sort of unsure like, "This is canon, right?
          This is canon. That's what this looks
          like," "Korrasami's canon. That's
          what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
          up to that point, there really hadn't been
          a whole lot of huge representation for female ships. So, these big cartoons that are
          for kids are doing more
          for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
          kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
          much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust." So, to
          see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
          god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
          have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
          watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
          because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
          and so on. So I got into forums and fans would translate for
          those of us who didn't speak Hindi. And obviously people would
          answer questions if you asked because you couldn't get everything in the
          translations or the summaries. And during that time, we would talk about the plot
          of
          the show, what the characters were doing, where we were expecting things to go at
          that time. It was just a lot of the basic things at fandom.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>To realizing that
          there was a community of people who were also interested in discussing how these
          shows and books and games et cetera were failing us, whether it was in terms of the
          content or the representation or just releasing new things like thought arcs that
          weren't followed through on.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I was on Twitter casually
          scrolling through something, and someone from back home happened to mention how the
          finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background and
          the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
          that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
          Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
          I
          could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
          been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
          how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way. But also the
          fics I had read after the show had finished
          seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ... Obviously, it was a
          really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had happened in the gap
          years that they hadn't shown us for Korra. I kind of wanted to see
          that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular, and this was surprising
          for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I never really remember to
          think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like there was this big gap
          available to us for exploration.  So I kind
          of wanted to explore that and see how Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for
          me I like to see how the characters are responding to what's happening to them
          rather than having the plot happen to them, and with Asami there was just so much
          room to do that.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think I was
          both going for an understanding of how Asami herself is effected by this really
          terrible thing we see happen to Korra. everyone has seen someone who they think is
          all-powerful and
          infallible, invulnerable to an extent, be ... I don't want to say broken, but be injured
          in a really drastic way and them not
          being able to do anything much to help with her recovery in concrete
          ways. But the imagery
          also for that chapter was, I guess, built in subtext because I wasn't quite sure yet
          how to engage with what was happening
          in ways that were visible to other people outside of the fan community, the
          slashfan community.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> It has less to do with fandom
          itself and more to do with the external world. And even now it's, I guess it's ...
          I
          don't know. I think it just seemed
          like the safer option at the time.  But the more time I've
          spent in that part of fandom, the less I guess I've cared about how it's read or
          whatever it is. But at the time, it just seemed wiser, particularly if I was having
          others who may not ... Because fan works and original work for me are on the same
          level, and so I'm not concerned, I guess, with people reading it for ... people
          reading it and not seeing a difference in quality, but rather how they experience
          the content. And so I think I was still considering who the audience would
          be.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it's just existing
          personally as a marginalized person. The way that that storyline was handled in LOK,
          I think I wasn't quite comfortable with it, just the very idea of the movement
          disappearing because of one man's end. It seems so unrealistic because there was a
          real situation with inequality there. Because we see that the world has adapted to
          cater for benders, and we don't quite know non-benders are faring in that world,
          what kind of opportunities they're having. And based on the conflict that the show
          raised, it was clear that non-benders were in a position where they weren't having
          ends meet or they weren't getting the jobs that they hoped to get. So both
          as a black person and as a woman, it was just important for me to recognize that
          in text and get around to exploring what that might have meant for other
          characters who weren't within the Circle of the Avatar and had powerful
          connections. The universe raises really
          interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
          we
          kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
          thing about fandom and fan
          fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that either there
          wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important enough to
          explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always in the
          forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the world," not
          just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
          through.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I wasn't part of the fandom itself, so I didn't quite get to be part of ... Maybe
          I
          should be happy for that because I missed all the fan wars.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I missed the
          smug satisfaction, but I also missed all the stress and anger, so I'm happy for
          that.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Considering my
          Supergirl years, I can imagine. And then when you [inaudible
          00:45:32]
          Korra is an avatar who's a
          woman.
          She's not a dainty fainting flower that
          they love.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think for that
          particular story I had to remind myself, especially because I had read so many fan
          fictions where this was ... And I know it's understandable, but I kind find it a
          flaw for some people. Just keeping the world in focus. Because there is this thing
          in fan fiction where we assume that all people who are
          accessing it are familiar with the text. And while that is often common when we want
          it to function beyond that world to have relevance in other ways, I think for me
          personally it's important to integrate more parts of the world, of the
          universe. For me, it was just
          reminding myself that, even though I'm writing something where there are people who
          are familiar with the text, it's also important to fill in the blanks
          sometimes.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think, and I'll probably go with my own fandom experiences,
          it just comes back to how the world is constructed externally. So just even the
          idea of imagining inside of what was placed before us, it takes a special kind
          of familiarity with the boarders of the world to imagine a world that is
          different from what is presented to you. At the time, I don't know, it was just that
          Korra
          and Mako were what was the norm. And so I think it made sense for some people to
          only be able to see that happening. I mean, I didn't see the possibility of
          Korrasami until the very end. But when I circled back around
          after having spent about several months reading several fan fictions</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But yeah, I just,
          spending so much time reading so much fan fiction from LOK and then branching
          out into Steven Universe and moving from Steven Universe into Supergirl, there
          was just more of an interaction with another side of fandom, the slash side of
          fandom. I don't know. I think you have to be integrated with others who are
          looking for more than what's presented, looking for more than what's norm,
          what's the acceptable way of telling a story of any kind of relationship really.
          Because even when you talk
          about what characters are bound to get more attention and more interesting and
          so on and so forth, when you look at fandom in general you'll find that when
          those characters are black or just generally a person of color in comparison to
          a character being white, that people are least particular when the fandom's
          dominated by white faces and so forth. They are more likely to explore those
          characters and to humanize them and to want to get to know them better, while
          other characters and what their hopes and dreams and ideas might be for the
          world are pushed to the side.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't know. I'm not surprised. Plus the allocishets tend to dominate fandom in
          general, so it made sense that they would sort of own the sandbox and everyone
          else should be playing to the side.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I mean, people are
          out there writing Korra Tarrlok fanfic. Okay, but Korrasami just seems too weird,
          okay
          people. I mean, I was also part of it too, that people were so willing to see all
          these other, in some
          ways really twisted, relationship dynamics, but couldn't quite bring themselves to
          see what others
          were seeing when they took the allocishet glasses off. I was
          part of that group as well, until in the end. When I saw that I was
          like, "Okay. This is pretty blatant. I don't see how anyone is not seeing
          this." But I can't judge because when you go back and you see
          the way that Korra and Asami speak to each other in the beginning, it's there, but
          it's not intentional subtext. It's like ... I mean, it makes sense that some people
          didn't see it.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I
          think it may have come back to that as well, a combination of both familiarity with
          visual cues in storytelling, both a tendency to read closer in text in general,
          whether it's literature or visual media, as well as having familiarized yourself
          with another community. I'm always on
          the fence sometimes when I'm talking about how people are seeing or not seeing
          certain things. Because even with my current fandom, it's like half the people
          are saying that we're delusional or creating things where there aren't things.
          And then other times you see these exact phenomena occurring in cishet
          media.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At that time ...
          When I first came across it, I was like, "They're probably overreacting," because
          I
          know how fandom can get.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I'm like, "In what
          world am I supposed to view this as platonic? I mean, I know I was raised in a pretty
          fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing here things
          that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
          00:58:53] people." So that's when I became a
          believer. And the longer I watched the show, the more it seemed to grow. And you could
          tell, from a fandom perspective, some people
          who are cishet won't be able to speak to this, but you could
          tell that the writer's room was split in how they were portraying the characters
          because I think they got
          uncomfortable with how fandom was growing so rapidly and intensely around these
          two characters, even to the
          point where they used the black character as a wedge between
          them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
          in that show. </li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
          to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
          bi-sexual. I used it sort of as a tool in some fan fics to work
          through ideas or feelings that I'd had and didn't know how to properly verbalize
          yet. I was putting them on paper, using another
          character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
          where I felt I was kind of safe to do so. I didn't always
          publish all of them, but the one that you contacted me over, I did,
          obviously.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
          show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
          just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
          not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
          female-female relationships as well, because a lot of the media already does a lot
          of
          the male-female exploration. And a lot of the purpose of fandom
          is to sort of explore beyond what we're just given.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, definitely when it comes to trying to write it
          realistically as well, but the banter back and forth was very difficult. I read a
          lot of fan fic where it can be very stalkish and when I think about it and I think
          about someone saying it out loud, I just like cringe. My face caves in. writing it
          also based off
          of my own experiences, just exploring the LGBT
          community in my area, I was kind of writing it from that
          perspective, but also not having as much information as I would like.  That, and also
          trying to write
          and finish an entire fan fic in one sitting is very difficult when it's in a public
          setting. Luckily, it happened and it was a nice exercise as well, just also to be
          able to sit and write and have it really done in one sitting and then put it out
          there was very satisfying.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to actually put some Game
          of Thrones content on those tags to begin with because back when I was writing it,
          there wasn't a lot really going for it. LGBT fan fics, yeah sure, but
          gender fluid and gender
          related things, it wasn't really there. While I do ship them together romantically,
          I
          wanted to write something that also reflected that you could do like a very intimate
          moment without bring sex into it as well. I feel for them, a lot of their fics also
          had a lot of like Jaime
          being the man and Brienne finally being able to let her guard
          down. It's
          something that I wanted to, again, wanted to bring into a fan fic to kind of make
          it
          more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and
          wondering the same thing. Like, where is this content that
          should be out there because it's in the books and why is no one taking this up and
          writing about it?</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think I would want to go
          more into maybe tagging some of the triggers maybe now a days because back then
          there wasn't as much of a discussion around it. Now a days, you have more of a
          discussion around what bigger tags to put in to help people avoid it for instance.
          Now that AO3 has updated its tagging system to include and exclude.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
          actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
          how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
          how she had gotten to living with Jaime. I just find their relationship in
          canon to be so interesting because it was one of
          the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
          pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
          surprised. Brienne was what a lot of
          these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
          places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
          and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
          of her issues with not being able
          to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
          heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
          always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
          gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable There's a lot
          of, again, fan fic already out there of
          them being intimate, but it was all
          very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
          vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
          I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
          own instead.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>And then it just kind of gets more
          depressing as it goes on. For some reason, John and Sansa's the most popular ship.
          It's like, I understand that they're not technically related, but I don't get it
          because in the book, they had this very tense relationship and in the show I know
          that they were more around each other. Peytr/Sansa, I want to have some words with
          people. I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
          them, but I
          don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
          just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
          literally right here.
          Renly/Lauris,
          obviously. Sandor and Sansa, I will say that I like their ship name
          as San-San. I do understand the whole
          like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
          romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
          just write a Nora Roberts novel." I'd so read her books if I
          wanted to. I don't need to read them here. Most Game of Thrones fan fic is incredibly
          hetero
          normative and it's a lot of university AU, high school AU and
          I'm like, "What about literally anything else?" I did a modern universe
          [inaudible 00:37:49] Please, literally anything
          else.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Again, it's Renly/Lauris,
          Sansa/Marjory. Yeah, there's not a lot really on there.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was just a lot of Nora Roberts style in AO3 for
          sure. A lot of incest. An exorbitant amount of
          incest, like beyond what I even take it. I'm typically very do what you want,
          but even now, I'm just like don't like that.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, it's depressingly small. I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
          less fan fic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
          unique friendship/relationship as like a side note, I think the show really undercut
          Jaime and Brienne's
          relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
          kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her. I was
          like, "Boy is a head shorter than her." That was part of the appeal was that Jaime
          had this big, beautiful wife that was taller than him
          and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
          wonderful?" That was part of what made it so enjoyable a lot of
          the fics, even with Jaime and Brienne is just depressingly, like, "Wow, if I
          wanted to read this fic, I'd just go to like any romance section and find
          it."</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I would almost want to just write fic out of
          spite.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That would have been a good way to end it, not, we're going to hug
          each other and we're going to let some rocks fall. I had some really bad, some
          really heated discussions with a friend on my dashboard on Twitter. We just did that,
          like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
          and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
          interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
          dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
          front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
          interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
          not try and put this away. Yeah, it was a whole mess. People
          came out in droves, angry for different reasons.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a very hard time
          getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
          motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
          are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
          that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
          top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges. Or if
          you're using words, and I'm like, okay, I've never heard that word used on the show,
          so now you've just dropped a bomb in the middle of a wedding cake, and there's cake
          everywhere. It just pulls me out.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yes. She's a weird character. Mostly she seems to almost
          be absent from things. She's window dressing. She's there, she doesn't speak, or she
          speaks, it's one or two sentences in the entire fic. And it's frustrating because
          once again in the book, she's such a pivotal character. And so, you get those fics
          where she
          either has none of those, she's either not there, or she has really none of those
          attributes. She's kind of just a yes person. Yes, Khaleesi, no Khaleesi, yes my
          queen. That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
          delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
          Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
          away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
          one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
          fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
          of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
          if I was a former slave. The one thing I
          would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
          in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
          into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
          anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
          like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fan fiction. She's really an
          underused character.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
          thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
          in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
          and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
          unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
          me
          try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
          There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
          improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful. The
          "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
          People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
          right there." So I had the "What if." Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
          The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
          right. Ratings may change, warnings may change, series,
          spoilers, all those kind of speak for themselves, just to let you know that okay,
          once again, this isn't static. This is something that changes story by story. Some
          of them may be Gen, some of them, I haven't written one yet, but some of them may
          be
          adult in the future. Some of them may have a lot of violence in them, so just be
          aware. Don't ever come back to this fic and think, "This is what it is." Because
          that's not it. I think my
          characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
          "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
          it may be out of character." Like I said, new fandoms are hard because they
          are. I have a lot of Game of Thrones stuff on the cutting
          room floor, before I decided what to actually post. And there is about 20 other
          drabbles for the one series that haven't made it yet, because I'm one of those
          writers. Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
          that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that Alternate universe, canon
          divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
          want to get blasted on that one. Missandei deserved
          better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
          they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
          would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23]. Fluff and angst, I
          cannot write straight fluff. I'm incapable. You have to have pain with your
          pleasure. I can't do it.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I've learned a lot about people actually in the fandom.
          Game of Thrones has a very active fandom. I wasn't prepared for that when I joined.
          You get people who, there are the butts, there are the trolls. Trolls are going to
          troll though, so I just kind of push them to the side. But there are people who
          they're really willing to engage with you, and they have questions. In a lot of
          other fandoms, some people are just like, "This is a nice story." Game of Thrones
          fans will have questions for you in the comments. They'll be like, "What about this?
          And what about this? Oh, what about this? What do you think about this?" It's fun
          to
          get that dialog. That's something I never had before. In one of my other fics, there's
          the Deviant Lord. We
          will run out of the character requirement, talking to each other back and forth in
          comments about things. I learned a little bit, I actually had to do a bit of
          research on some of the fic, for things like trauma, and how people respond to
          trauma. Especially in the case of Sansa and Missandei, how do people overcome
          certain difficulties after being in these different positions? That was a little bit
          interesting. I did a little bit of in-depth on that, because once again, I'm that
          nerd.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually
          had one troll who just wrote, "Fuck you, you bastard." And I was like, yes. I was
          just like, "Whoa. Okay. I'm sorry you're having such a bad day. Go have a mimosa.
          Just don't take it out on me." But
          there are just people who are just nasty. In all the fandoms I've been in, it
          thankfully hasn't happened to me yet, and I've actually had people defend me in
          comments. They're just like, "Get that shit out of here." I'm like, "Okay, thank you
          for being nice." But it seems the Game of Throne fandoms can get real violent. They
          get real virulent with their hatred in the comments section. I can't muster that
          kind of hatred. If I don't like something, I just click off of it. I don't get the
          hate.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But I can
          see, especially in Season Five, and Six, and Seven, where you see Jon Snow, Sansa
          Stark, because these two characters kind of get back together in the show. When
          they're together, you can see their dynamic in everything else. And they look good
          together. That's always a good thing. It's always big when it comes to shipping, who
          looks good with who. But I think people really enjoy the Jaime Lannister, Brienne
          of
          Tarth is kind of like the person, your frenemy. The person you love to hate.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
          and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
          stalker-y. Sansa, Petyr, I've always hated that one, simply because he's grooming.
          It's
          very obvious. Where I can see Sansa starting to like Sandor
          because he would rebuff her at every turn if she started to show interest in him,
          even though he didn't want to. He'd just be like, "I can't deal with this. I can't
          deal with you." Petyr would relish that. He
          does everything he can to get her into trusting him, and thinking of him as her
          friend, and I would do anything for you, and that's really, really creepy. It's
          always a surprise to me when I see Petyr Baelish, Sansa Stark fics especially
          ones where it's not manipulative, and coercive, and creepy, I'm like, "What are
          you guys seeing in that?" That's just odd.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I like the modern setting. Modern setting seems to be the most
          common one.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
          active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
          especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
          and
          putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>canon divergence, angst, love, romance, smut. Not really. Everything seems to be kind
          of
          right where it should be, based on what I've seen. I'm trying to think of a tag that
          may
          be missing. No. Fluff, yeah, fluff's there, angst, romance. No, I think everything
          is
          there. You just randomly go on AO3, that's what you'd see.</li>
    </ul>
