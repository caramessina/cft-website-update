     <h3>Quotes</h3>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't want to be like, "Ah, but I'm writing the version of this character that's
           a woman." I hate that. I know that that's permissible with the meta text but I don't
           want to be part of that.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world
           and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting,"
           instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with
           it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's
           also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that
           I really was not before.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
           about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
           those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and I
           couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing I
           was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I guess the first three, they're basic tags. You want to read angst, here's angst.
           You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy
           but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then the last one's a content warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see
           homophobia. I can't not publish a story about homophobia.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of
           the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was
           more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll
           do alternate points of view."</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't know if I thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought
           about it as a storytelling tool obviously that helps power [inaudible 00:17:00], not
           necessarily about the story if it makes sense. I wasn't telling you things that had
           happened in the past, to teach you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This
           is what's haunting the characters, this is what the characters can't escape from in
           a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you
           know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes sense.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>If I remember correctly, this was about writing about suicide. I had been in a fight
           for a very long time. And I was nearly constantly suicidal. And so writing this piece
           was an engaging... It was obviously triggering.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
           love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
           stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
           of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
           of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
           "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
           who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
           of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that people writing about suffering and happiness, a lot of things happen
           in love stories in general, particularly in WlW and MlM stuff. Well, I don't know
           if MlM, I don't read it very much just because one, I am not a man, and two, so much
           MlM stuff is kind of uncomfortable? A lot it's very clearly written by women.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon
           compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant,"
           as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant
           sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense
           to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a
           story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine
           that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on
           what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now.
           That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories
           that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And to be fair, omega and alpha as being there in the far right column. I don't really
           understand ABO [alpha, beta, omega] as in general, so I can't talk. They're not as
           inherently sexual. They definitely struck me as relatively sexual, and that's not</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But a few years later when I was, I think,
           13, my friend introduced me to like crack Lord Of The Rings fiction.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
           person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
           universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I chose to make it Desi because I am Desi. and I wanted
           to experience it.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I mean, I think the
           choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
           setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
           trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
           for it.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it was football RPF
           (real person fic) fanfiction. Which was very interesting, because I think it was
           just after the 2018 World Cup.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
           view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
           you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
           of
           view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
           what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
           more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah. I mean, I really do
           feel like there aren't that many second person point of views that kind of allow you
           to immerse yourself into that person, or into that character.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was literally
           just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
           as
           South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
           Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But when I was making the
           actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
           actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
           identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
           identify.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
           and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
           that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
           ideas from.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Just building that list kind of helps me know where and how
           I'm getting the material, and the assumptions that I've made throughout the fanfic.
           And, therefore, helps make it easier to kind of discuss it later, I think.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
           be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one of the
           primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
           sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it is an angsty fic. It's not like a comedy, there is angst.
           And it's one of the major points of the entire fanfic.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, this fic is obviously
           dramatized and all that. But the essential part of it is that both of them have
           this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
           that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
           see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
           very difficult way of going through life. And it's not
           necessarily a happy life that you lead when you have that kind of a
           mentality.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then
           the fact that the alternate universe for a modern setting is so
           [inaudible 01:07:54]. Which, to me, is very interesting.
           Because I tend to go out of my way to avoid modern alternate universes, because I
           personally don't like them.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, I think one of
           the major ones is fluff.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, you do
           see a lot of angst, though.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I didn't necessarily want to
           do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to
           a
           point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
           each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
           all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
           can't."</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I think for
           shorter things, there's a challenge in that you have, I think most of them ended up
           being 200-400 words, so you have to do an entire story in that time. You have to
           make somebody care about things that are happening in much fewer words, and make it
           more impactful in less amount of time. If you have 10,000 words to set up a
           situation and resolve it, and all that, it's definitely different from, "Here's just
           basically a gut punch of a story, and you maybe don't get the whole thing."</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a couple that, I don't
           remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
           [inaudible 00:09:21] on purpose, so that it had to be
           like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
           that.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
           was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
           think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
           prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
           I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
           I can sort of tailor it to that,"</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
           a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
           always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
           at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
           art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
           it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
           person's mind."</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even though it's 400 chapters, it's book-length. It's like a
           normal book length. It's easily digestible, and each thing's its own thing, so if
           you want to stop it and come back to it later, you can. People do usually, if you're
           feeling a specific mood, and go find that specific one and just go through a couple
           of those. I like that it's sort of, you don't have to have a super amount of
           emotional investment in it, like super long, 10-chapter fics that are 100,000
           words.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Like yes, it's very good. I enjoy it. But sometimes, I'm just in
           the mood for something light and I like that I can provide that for people who want
           that.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, the fact that
           it was short meant that I did only have a certain amount of words to deal with
           it.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. Well, absolutely
           part of it was wish fulfillment. I've never been in any sort of relationship, so it
           was like, "Okay, this is might what it be like." But also, I'm a big fan of the fact
           that, of using fanfiction, or TV shows, or movies, or any of that as escapism.
           You look out your window and things are just not
           good a lot of the time,
           so I really like reading things that are just
           soft and maybe things aren't so terrible for them where they are, and just sort
           of getting lost in the idea of, they can just relax. They've been through so
           much, they deserve a little bit of something that's not going to hurt them, with
           somebody who definitely wants the same for them, who wants the same for
           themselves. I tried to make that as a focus. Yeah, I just
           really wanted that.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
           different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
           know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
           way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
           So, I tried to mix it up on occasion.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even in the modern drabbles, or the
           other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
           she can access that.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Things like that, you notice immediately, but also that
           it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
           I
           don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
           trying to get portrayed.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I
           try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
           to live with a person she loves, doing
           something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
           complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
           obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
           yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
           be happy.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
           serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
           just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
           things that made me super uncomfortable.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I wanted it to, like everything
           else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
           to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, these big cartoons that are for kids are doing more
           for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
           kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
           much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust."</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But
           basically where you would participate with one fan writing a line, the next fan
           writing another line and so on and so forth. So that was the first time that I
           actually wrote anything fandom related.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And then there was a bit of a lull until my delving into the
           Indian forums. And there we would do the meta analysis and satirical writings and
           so
           on. </li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I completely forgot, there was a
           period where I would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because
           I
           don't do that anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment
           with writing and being critical of source materials and so on.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I started writing and initially my own fanfic, so self insert fan
           fic when I was like maybe about 10 years old.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>You never
           really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
           to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
           with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
           wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
           Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
           because obviously they wouldn't be having as
           much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
           considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
           day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
           from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
           versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
           wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
           identity. But there would definitely be some push
           back, but how would that change based on the setting?
           I made her a little bit more comfortable in
           her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
           shoulder for Jaime
           who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
           well.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>from the source material where I wanted to kind of
           explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
           because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
           as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
           actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
           how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
           how she had gotten to living with Jaime.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
           way and being very new, if you're very new into
           like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
           a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
           higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
           or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
           You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
           anything.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That's definitely
           something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
           of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
           would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
           more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
           me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
           anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
           all of that.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted
           to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
           in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
           that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
           wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
           their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
           that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
           work through those emotions with me.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
           guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
           to when I came out to them.
           I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
           of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
           having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
           leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
           little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of write it as like a self-fulfilling
           fantasy as well as like how I would have pictured them actually going through
           it.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I learned how much writing a one shot sounds good and all in
           practice, but then it ends up opening all these other doors of should I write more,
           should I write less. I don't know what I should be doing with this.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was
           definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
           back and explore myself with fan
           fic if I needed to as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Most Game of Thrones fanfic is incredibly hetero
           normative and it's a lot of university AU, high school AU and
           I'm like, "What about literally anything else?" I did a modern universe
           [inaudible 00:37:49] Please, literally anything
           else.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And I actually really liked a
           show called Xena: Warrior Princess. That was kind of my very first fandom. I really
           liked, see I can't even remember now, Ares and Gabrielle. I wrote a fanfiction
           about them that was set in modern times. That was my very first fan
           fic.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>X-Men comics. And I wrote a story, once
           again, set in modern times. I kind of do this a lot. I take characters out of their
           setting and transpose them into reality.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
           know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
           And
           it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
           What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
           And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
           and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
           the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
           that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
           world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
           would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
           maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
           how I got into that.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Let me just zero in on
           the one moment that I think is pivotal, and just kind of get that out, and then
           leave it alone. Because a lot of my drabbles, they are parts of much bigger fics.
           I
           just haven't posted them.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
           written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
           okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
           alone.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
           "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
           People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
           right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Fix-it, cause they're mostly fix-it.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Fluff and angst, I
           cannot write straight fluff. I'm incapable. You have to have pain with your
           pleasure. I can't do it.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because it has to hurt
           if it's to heal.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
           agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
           dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
           that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
           Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
           we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
           that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
           her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
           supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
           that.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
           the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
           so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
           Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
           and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But I think people really enjoy the Jaime Lannister, Brienne of
           Tarth is kind of like the person, your frenemy. The person you love to hate.
           I would rescue you if you're falling off a cliff, but I'd probably punch you in the
           stomach when I got you back on solid land for being in that position to begin
           with.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I like the modern setting. Modern setting seems to be the most
           common one.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
           active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
           especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
           and
           putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>canon divergence, angst, love, romance, smut. Not really. Everything seems to be kind
           of
           right where it should be, based on what I've seen. I'm trying to think of a tag that
           may
           be missing. No. Fluff, yeah, fluff's there, angst, romance. No, I think everything
           is
           there. You just randomly go on AO3, that's what you'd see.</li>

      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that people writing about suffering and happiness, a lot of things happen
         in love stories in general, particularly in WlW and MlM stuff. Well, I don't know
         if MlM, I don't read it very much just because one, I am not a man, and two, so much
         MlM stuff is kind of uncomfortable? A lot it's very clearly written by women.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it is an angsty fic. It's not like a comedy, there is angst.
         And it's one of the major points of the entire fanfic.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, this fic is obviously
         dramatized and all that. But the essential part of it is that both of them have
         this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
         that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
         see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
         very difficult way of going through life. And it's not
         necessarily a happy life that you lead when you have that kind of a
         mentality.</li>

            You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy
            but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance.</li>
         <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
            love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
            stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
            of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
            of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
            "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
            who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
            of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
         <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, I think one of
            the major ones is fluff.</li>
         <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Like yes, it's very good. I enjoy it. But sometimes, I'm just in
            the mood for something light and I like that I can provide that for people who want
            that.</li>
         <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. Well, absolutely
            part of it was wish fulfillment. I've never been in any sort of relationship, so it
            was like, "Okay, this is might what it be like." But also, I'm a big fan of the fact
            that, of using fanfiction, or TV shows, or movies, or any of that as escapism.
            You look out your window and things are just not
            good a lot of the time,
            so I really like reading things that are just
            soft and maybe things aren't so terrible for them where they are, and just sort
            of getting lost in the idea of, they can just relax. They've been through so
            much, they deserve a little bit of something that's not going to hurt them, with
            somebody who definitely wants the same for them, who wants the same for
            themselves. I tried to make that as a focus. Yeah, I just
            really wanted that.</li>
         <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I
            try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
            to live with a person she loves, doing
            something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
            complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
            obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
            yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
            be happy.</li>
         <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
            serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
            just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
            things that made me super uncomfortable.</li>
         <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I wanted it to, like everything
            else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
            to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it.</li>
         <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Fluff and angst, I
            cannot write straight fluff. I'm incapable. You have to have pain with your

    <h3>Quotes</h3>
    <ul>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I didn't necessarily want to
          do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to
          a
          point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
          each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
          all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
          can't."</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I think for
          shorter things, there's a challenge in that you have, I think most of them ended up
          being 200-400 words, so you have to do an entire story in that time. You have to
          make somebody care about things that are happening in much fewer words, and make it
          more impactful in less amount of time. If you have 10,000 words to set up a
          situation and resolve it, and all that, it's definitely different from, "Here's just
          basically a gut punch of a story, and you maybe don't get the whole thing."</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a couple that, I don't
          remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
          [inaudible 00:09:21] on purpose, so that it had to be
          like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
          that.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even though it's 400 chapters, it's book-length. It's like a
          normal book length. It's easily digestible, and each thing's its own thing, so if
          you want to stop it and come back to it later, you can. People do usually, if you're
          feeling a specific mood, and go find that specific one and just go through a couple
          of those. I like that it's sort of, you don't have to have a super amount of
          emotional investment in it, like super long, 10-chapter fics that are 100,000
          words.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, the fact that
          it was short meant that I did only have a certain amount of words to deal with
          it.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
          different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
          know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
          way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
          So, I tried to mix it up on occasion.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Things like that, you notice immediately, but also that
          it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
          I
          don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
          trying to get portrayed.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Let me just zero in on
          the one moment that I think is pivotal, and just kind of get that out, and then
          leave it alone. Because a lot of my drabbles, they are parts of much bigger fics.

          South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
          Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But when I was making the
          actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
          actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
          identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
          identify.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
          and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
          that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
          ideas from.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Just building that list kind of helps me know where and how
          I'm getting the material, and the assumptions that I've made throughout the fanfic.
          And, therefore, helps make it easier to kind of discuss it later, I think.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one of the
          primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
          sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>

    <h3>Quotes</h3>
    <ul>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't want to be like, "Ah, but I'm writing the version of this character that's
          a woman." I hate that. I know that that's permissible with the meta text but I don't
          want to be part of that.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I chose to make it Desi because I am Desi. and I wanted
          to experience it.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I mean, I think the
          choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
          setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
          trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
          for it.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
          be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>You never
          really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
          to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
          with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
          wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
          Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
          because obviously they wouldn't be having as
          much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
          considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
          day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
          from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
          versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
          wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
          identity. But there would definitely be some push
          back, but how would that change based on the setting?
          I made her a little bit more comfortable in
          her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
          shoulder for Jaime
          who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
          well.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
          way and being very new, if you're very new into
          like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
          a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
          higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
          or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
          You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
          anything.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
          wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
          their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
          that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
          work through those emotions with me.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of write it as like a self-fulfilling
          fantasy as well as like how I would have pictured them actually going through
          it.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was
          definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
          back and explore myself with fan
          fic if I needed to as well.</li>

       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then
          the fact that the alternate universe for a modern setting is so
          [inaudible 01:07:54]. Which, to me, is very interesting.
          Because I tend to go out of my way to avoid modern alternate universes, because I
          personally don't like them.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>You never
          really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying

          who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
          well.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>from the source material where I wanted to kind of
          explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
          because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
          as well.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
          actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
          how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
          how she had gotten to living with Jaime.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That's definitely
          something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
          of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
          would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
          more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
          me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
          anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
          all of that.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted
          to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
          in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
          that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Most Game of Thrones fanfic is incredibly hetero
          normative and it's a lot of university AU, high school AU and
          I'm like, "What about literally anything else?" I did a modern universe
          [inaudible 00:37:49] Please, literally anything
          else.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And I actually really liked a
          show called Xena: Warrior Princess. That was kind of my very first fandom. I really
          liked, see I can't even remember now, Ares and Gabrielle. I wrote a fanfiction
          about them that was set in modern times. That was my very first fan
          fic.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>X-Men comics. And I wrote a story, once
          again, set in modern times. I kind of do this a lot. I take characters out of their
          setting and transpose them into reality.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I like the modern setting. Modern setting seems to be the most
          common one.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
          active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
          especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
          and
          putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>

    <h3>Quotes</h3>
    <ul>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world
          and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting,"
          instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with
          it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's
          also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that
          I really was not before.</li>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
          about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
          those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and I
          couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing I
          was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of
          the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was
          more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll
          do alternate points of view."</li>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't know if I thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought
          about it as a storytelling tool obviously that helps power [inaudible 00:17:00], not
          necessarily about the story if it makes sense. I wasn't telling you things that had
          happened in the past, to teach you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This
          is what's haunting the characters, this is what the characters can't escape from in
          a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you
          know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes sense.</li>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon
          compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant,"
          as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant
          sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense
          to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a
          story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine
          that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on
          what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now.
          That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories
          that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra</li>
       <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And to be fair, omega and alpha as being there in the far right column. I don't really
          understand ABO [alpha, beta, omega] as in general, so I can't talk. They're not as
          inherently sexual. They definitely struck me as relatively sexual, and that's not</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But a few years later when I was, I think,
          13, my friend introduced me to like crack Lord Of The Rings fiction.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
          person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
          universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it was football RPF
          (real person fic) fanfiction. Which was very interesting, because I think it was
          just after the 2018 World Cup.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
          view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
          you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
          of
          view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
          what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
          more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
       <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah. I mean, I really do
          feel like there aren't that many second person point of views that kind of allow you
          to immerse yourself into that person, or into that character.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
          was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
          think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
          prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
          I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
          I can sort of tailor it to that,"</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
          a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
          always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
          at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
          art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
          it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
          person's mind."</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even in the modern drabbles, or the
          other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
          she can access that.</li>
       <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, these big cartoons that are for kids are doing more
          for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
          kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
          much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust."</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But
          basically where you would participate with one fan writing a line, the next fan
          writing another line and so on and so forth. So that was the first time that I
          actually wrote anything fandom related.</li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And then there was a bit of a lull until my delving into the
          Indian forums. And there we would do the meta analysis and satirical writings and
          so
          on. </li>
       <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I completely forgot, there was a
          period where I would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because
          I
          don't do that anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment
          with writing and being critical of source materials and so on.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I started writing and initially my own fanfic, so self insert fan
          fic when I was like maybe about 10 years old.</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
          guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
          to when I came out to them.
          I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
          of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
          having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
          leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
          little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime</li>
       <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I learned how much writing a one shot sounds good and all in
          practice, but then it ends up opening all these other doors of should I write more,
          should I write less. I don't know what I should be doing with this.</li>
       <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because it has to hurt
          if it's to heal.</li>
