  <h2>Rhetorical Genre Studies: Genre</h2>
   <h3>Angst</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I guess the first three, they're basic tags. You want to read angst, here's angst.
         You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy
         but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance. And then the last one's a content
         warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see homophobia. I can't not publish a
         story about homophobia.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I don't know, I don't know if I'd use the fluff and angst tags anymore, just because
         I don't talk about my literature in those terms as much anymore, as I used to, but...
         Largely because nobody...You don't use those tags as much anymore in my view, like
         we don't talk about... Those are very much Fanfiction.net-y terms that pulled over,
         I don't see them as I used to. I think that people writing about suffering and happiness,
         a lot of things happen in love stories in general, particularly in WlW and MlM stuff.
         Well, I don't know if MlM, I don't read it very much just because one, I am not a
         man, and two, so much MlM stuff is kind of uncomfortable? A lot it's very clearly
         written by women.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
         clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
         Jon is raised a Targaryen. And it is an angsty fic. It's not like a comedy, there
         is angst.
         And it's one of the major points of the entire fanfic. And the reason I did the Jodhaa
         Akbar tag was actually
         because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
         other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
         fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
         particular tag. I mean, this fic is obviously
         dramatized and all that. But the essential part of it is that both of them have
         this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
         that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
         see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
         very difficult way of going through life. And it's not
         necessarily a happy life that you lead when you have that kind of a
         mentality.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, I think one of
         the major ones is fluff. I mean, you do
         see a lot of angst, though.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
         thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
         in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
         and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
         unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
         me
         try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
         There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
         improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful. The
         "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
         People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
         right there." So I had the "What if." Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
         The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
         right. Ratings may change, warnings may change, series,
         spoilers, all those kind of speak for themselves, just to let you know that okay,
         once again, this isn't static. This is something that changes story by story. Some
         of them may be Gen, some of them, I haven't written one yet, but some of them may
         be
         adult in the future. Some of them may have a lot of violence in them, so just be
         aware. Don't ever come back to this fic and think, "This is what it is." Because
         that's not it. I think my
         characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
         "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
         it may be out of character." Like I said, new fandoms are hard because they
         are. I have a lot of Game of Thrones stuff on the cutting
         room floor, before I decided what to actually post. And there is about 20 other
         drabbles for the one series that haven't made it yet, because I'm one of those
         writers. Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
         that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that Alternate universe, canon
         divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
         want to get blasted on that one. Missandei deserved
         better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
         they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
         would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23]. Fluff and angst, I
         cannot write straight fluff. I'm incapable. You have to have pain with your
         pleasure. I can't do it.</li>
   </ul>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I guess the first three, they're basic tags. You want to read angst, here's angst.
         You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy
         but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance. And then the last one's a content
         warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see homophobia. I can't not publish a
         story about homophobia.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
         love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
         stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
         of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
         of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
         "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
         who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
         of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, I think one of
         the major ones is fluff. I mean, you do
         see a lot of angst, though.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I like that a lot of people, I still get comments
         occasionally that are, "I've just gone through this whole thing," and you can do
         that. Even though it's 400 chapters, it's book-length. It's like a
         normal book length. It's easily digestible, and each thing's its own thing, so if
         you want to stop it and come back to it later, you can. People do usually, if you're
         feeling a specific mood, and go find that specific one and just go through a couple
         of those. I like that it's sort of, you don't have to have a super amount of
         emotional investment in it, like super long, 10-chapter fics that are 100,000
         words. Like yes, it's very good. I enjoy it. But sometimes, I'm just in
         the mood for something light and I like that I can provide that for people who want
         that. I also like that you can sort of see a progression of
         how I wrote them and how my own skills have maybe, hopefully developed. And even
         just, it did end up being four years' worth of time so it was, when I think I started
         it, Korrasami hadn't
         been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
         And maybe, I think,
         during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
         different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
         strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. Well, absolutely
         part of it was wish fulfillment. I've never been in any sort of relationship, so it
         was like, "Okay, this is might what it be like." But also, I'm a big fan of the fact
         that, of using fanfiction, or TV shows, or movies, or any of that as escapism.
         You look out your window and things are just not
         good a lot of the time,
         so I really like reading things that are just
         soft and maybe things aren't so terrible for them where they are, and just sort
         of getting lost in the idea of, they can just relax. They've been through so
         much, they deserve a little bit of something that's not going to hurt them, with
         somebody who definitely wants the same for them, who wants the same for
         themselves. I tried to make that as a focus. Yeah, I just
         really wanted that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, again, it was the prompts, but it was
         also, I have personally been a little conflicted on gender for a while, and it's
         like my sexuality, it was something that I sort of just say, "Well, I'll get to
         that when I have the chance." So, it's always just sort of in
         the back of my head I
         try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
         to live with a person she loves, doing
         something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
         complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
         obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
         yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
         be happy. And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
         that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
         most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
         see what they're going through and you see how their lives are,
         and I try not to speak for situations that I've never lived through, but you can
         draw knowledge from that and say, "Okay, well, without going in depth into feelings
         or things like that, I can add this, this, and this, and make it maybe relatable in
         that regard."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
         serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
         just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
         things that made me super uncomfortable. And it's also, given the
         audience, this is considered a family show. So, I realized over time that maybe I
         don't have to write that. If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
         it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
         press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
         slaves is super ... I didn't want to
         contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
         [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
         more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
         been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
         thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
         though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
         for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it. It was
         partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
         Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City, I wanted
         it to, like everything
         else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
         to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it. There's a writer, whose name
         I always mess up. I want to
         say it's coeurdastronaute. They do a lot of Clarke and Lexa
         stuff, but she sets the scene super well with like, "Here's the sky. Here's the
         roads. Here's the this," and I tried to emulate that. And I also wanted to give the
         collection itself a
         sendoff I was proud of. So, I spent a little bit more time on that than I did a lot
         of the other stuff, just let it marinate. "You know what? This is a good end, and
         hope you enjoyed," sort of thing.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
         thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
         in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
         and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
         unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
         me

         right there." So I had the "What if." Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
         The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything

         pleasure. I can't do it.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Vignette</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, it was definitely, when I first started it, it
         was, "Okay, well, I kind of just want to write, and I want to get better at writing,
         practicing it." I started it in college, and the professor I had at that time kept
         saying how, "If you want to get better at writing, you have to write 50,000 words,
         and then, you have to write another 50,000." "Really? All right. I'll just write,
         then. People will give me prompts and I'll just write those as they come in." And
         then, there were a lot of prompts that came in, surprisingly. I was able to stay
         consistent with it for, I want to say, two, three years. And it's funny, going back
         to the original ones, the
         older ones at least, and reading those, because you sent me one. I think it was
         chapter 37 you mentioned in your email, and I went back and read it and I was like,
         "Oof, I could do this a lot better now, I hope." Yeah. Just, I wanted to get better
         at it, and people
         were really good at giving me things that I could easily do at work, I didn't necessarily
         want to
         do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to
         a
         point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
         each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
         all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
         can't."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I think for
         shorter things, there's a challenge in that you have, I think most of them ended up
         being 200-400 words, so you have to do an entire story in that time. You have to
         make somebody care about things that are happening in much fewer words, and make it
         more impactful in less amount of time. If you have 10,000 words to set up a
         situation and resolve it, and all that, it's definitely different from, "Here's just
         basically a gut punch of a story, and you maybe don't get the whole thing." There's
         a couple that, I don't
         remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
         [inaudible 00:09:21] on purpose, so that it had to be
         like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I like that a lot of people, I still get comments
         occasionally that are, "I've just gone through this whole thing," and you can do
         that. Even though it's 400 chapters, it's book-length. It's like a
         normal book length. It's easily digestible, and each thing's its own thing, so if
         you want to stop it and come back to it later, you can. People do usually, if you're
         feeling a specific mood, and go find that specific one and just go through a couple
         of those. I like that it's sort of, you don't have to have a super amount of
         emotional investment in it, like super long, 10-chapter fics that are 100,000

         the mood for something light and I like that I can provide that for people who want
         that. I also like that you can sort of see a progression of
         how I wrote them and how my own skills have maybe, hopefully developed. And even
         just, it did end up being four years' worth of time so it was, when I think I started
         it, Korrasami hadn't
         been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
         And maybe, I think,
         during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
         different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
         strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, the fact that
         it was short meant that I did only have a certain amount of words to deal with
         it. So, if there were some things where I'd write the
         original drabble, and then I might get three more immediate requests in my inbox for
         a sequel, or for, "Can I get a full length thing of this?" And I didn't necessarily
         have the time or energy, or just the inclination in some cases. And sometimes, there
         were just
         prompts that were not necessarily things that I wanted to do or actively didn't want
         to do So, I would start to feel guilty, and sometimes
         would just push one out whether or not I felt it was up to par, even though I hoped
         it was.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
         different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
         know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
         way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
         So, I tried to mix it up on occasion. And
         okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
         notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
         figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
         she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
         Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
         things stand out immediately. Even in the modern drabbles, or the
         other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
         she can access that. And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
         gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
         age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
         she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
         life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
         all the time. I loved that. Even if, and I think
         once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
         maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
         to see
         that, but I liked that they
         weren't immediate, for the most part. They wanted to be friends first, but they were
         so good together that I wanted to be able to
         sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes. Things like that, you notice
         immediately, but also that
         it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
         I
         don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
         trying to get portrayed.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because I'm
         a length whore. That's the problem. I get into these fics, and I have these ideas,
         and then they expand out of control, and then I get into a story that's suddenly 30
         chapters long, and then I run out of steam. I'm one of those authors who does kind
         of get bored, and then starts cheating on my fic, which is happening right now in
         Game of Thrones. Let me just zero in on
         the one moment that I think is pivotal, and just kind of get that out, and then
         leave it alone. Because a lot of my drabbles, they are parts of much bigger fics.
         I
         just haven't posted them. That I've actually
         written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
         okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
         alone.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Fix-It</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
         know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Dr. Who episodes is Turn Left. And
         it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
         What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
         And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
         and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
         the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
         that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
         world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
         would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
         maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
         how I got into that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
         dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
         that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
         Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me. So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that. I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
         beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
         thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Author's Note</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I guess the first three, they're basic tags. You want to read angst, here's angst.
         You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy
         but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance. And then the last one's a content
         warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see homophobia. I can't not publish a
         story about homophobia.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>If I remember correctly, this was about writing about suicide. I had been in a fight
         for a very long time. And I was nearly constantly suicidal. And so writing this piece
         was an engaging... It was obviously triggering. It was a piece that was sufficiently
         about me that it would have been fun and helpful for a lot of people. But this, I
         think it was a good piece, it was a piece that was a whole other world to read</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I honestly expected nobody to do
         that. It's good to see that people are just as interested in a lot of it, in this
         stuff. You know? I think that the
         thing I wanted to keep in mind was that I was doing the research, but I was also not
         putting as much research into it as I probably should have if I wanted to make it
         historical fiction. I was literally
         just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
         as
         South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
         Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it. And that was one thing I
         wanted to be clear about.
         Because, yes, it was research. But I think I wanted to keep to the spirit of the
         movie, as well as the spirit of the A Song of Ice and Fire canon. But when I was making
         the
         actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
         actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
         identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
         identify. But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
         and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
         that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
         ideas from. Just building that list kind of helps me know where and how
         I'm getting the material, and the assumptions that I've made throughout the fanfic.
         And, therefore, helps make it easier to kind of discuss it later, I think. I was really
         worried about how it
         would be perceived by the fandom, how it would be received by people even outside
         of
         the fandom. Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
         be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner. So, that was one of the
         primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
         sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Identity Bending</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
         have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
         in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."
         I don't want to be like, "Ah, but I'm writing the version of this character that's
         a woman." I hate that. I know that that's permissible with the meta text but I don't
         want to be part of that. mostly I felt like I wound up just getting in like an extension
         of me arguing on the internet, which is not a super-healthy way of engaging with communities.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I chose to make it Desi because I am Desi. and I wanted
         to experience it. And if you're just starting from scratch, then it's
         difficult to create why two people would hate each other so much. I mean, you need
         to have that religious, and
         cultural, and those barriers in order for that to
         happen. So, I mean, I think the
         choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
         setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
         trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
         for it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I honestly expected nobody to do
         that. It's good to see that people are just as interested in a lot of it, in this
         stuff. You know? I think that the
         thing I wanted to keep in mind was that I was doing the research, but I was also not

         primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
         sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I wrote it in
         one sitting in a Starbucks near my university. It was around the
         time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary and
         I tried to sort of work things out with Jaime as the main focal character You never
         really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
         to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
         with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
         wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
         Jamie and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
         because obviously they wouldn't be having as
         much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
         considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
         day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
         from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
         versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
         wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
         identity. But there would definitely be some push
         back, but how would that change based on the setting?
         I made her a little bit more comfortable in
         her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
         shoulder for Jaime
         who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
         well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
         way and being very new, if you're very new into
         like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
         a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
         higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
         or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
         You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
         anything. That's definitely
         something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
         of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
         would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
         more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
         me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
         anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
         all of that.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
         reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
         very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
         and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit. I wanted something similar, but
         would still
         make me feel like that, but wanted to make it more intimate and feel like it was
         still just as opening, but with actions and not just with words. trying to work through
         gender things. I
         wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
         their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
         that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
         work through those emotions with me.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
         guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
         to when I came out to them.
         I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
         of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
         having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
         leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
         little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime I wanted to kind of write
         it as like a self-fulfilling
         fantasy as well as like how I would have pictured them actually going through
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>The first big one
         is never write an entire fan fic in Starbucks. I learned how much writing a one shot
         sounds good and all in
         practice, but then it ends up opening all these other doors of should I write more,
         should I write less. I don't know what I should be doing with this. It was
         definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
         back and explore myself with fan
         fic if I needed to as well.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Modern Setting</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then
         the fact that the alternate universe for a modern setting is so
         [inaudible 01:07:54]. Which, to me, is very interesting.
         Because I tend to go out of my way to avoid modern alternate universes, because I
         personally don't like them.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I wrote it in
         one sitting in a Starbucks near my university. It was around the
         time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary and
         I tried to sort of work things out with Jaime as the main focal character You never
         really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
         to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
         with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
         wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
         Jamie and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
         because obviously they wouldn't be having as
         much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was

         I made her a little bit more comfortable in

         shoulder for Jaime
         who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
         well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I got a very
         interesting response from someone. I believe, maybe a week or two after. They were
         like, "It's a really well written fan fic, it's great, but why in God's (capital G)
         name, did you make Jaime like this?" And the moment I saw capital G, I was like I
         see. I tried to be as cordial as I could and I explained what I said earlier about
         my inspiration from the source material where I wanted to kind of
         explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
         because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
         as well. Yeah, that was the one big kick
         back I got from someone. I was a little bit shocked that I got the capital G person,
         but what can you do?</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
         actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
         how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
         how she had gotten to living with Jaime. I just find their relationship in
         canon to be so interesting because it was one of
         the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
         pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
         surprised. Brienne was what a lot of
         these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
         places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
         and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
         of her issues with not being able
         to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
         heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
         always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
         gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable There's a lot
         of, again, fan fic already out there of
         them being intimate, but it was all
         very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
         vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
         I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
         own instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
         way and being very new, if you're very new into
         like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
         a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
         higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
         or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
         You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
         anything. That's definitely
         something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
         of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
         would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
         more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
         me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
         anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
         all of that.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, so at the
         same time I was writing this fan fic, I was writing another one that kind of delved
         into the timeline of how Jaime grew up. It went
         into his relationship with his father, he was caught walking in his mother's red
         heels and he got very scolded and punished for it. I wanted
         to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
         in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
         that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>And then it just kind of gets more
         depressing as it goes on. For some reason, John and Sansa's the most popular ship.
         It's like, I understand that they're not technically related, but I don't get it
         because in the book, they had this very tense relationship and in the show I know
         that they were more around each other. Peytr/Sansa, I want to have some words with
         people. I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
         them, but I
         don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
         just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
         literally right here.
         Renly/Lauris,
         obviously. Sandor and Sansa, I will say that I like their ship name
         as San-San. I do understand the whole
         like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
         romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
         just write a Nora Roberts novel." I'd so read her books if I
         wanted to. I don't need to read them here. Most Game of Thrones fan fic is incredibly
         hetero
         normative and it's a lot of university AU, high school AU and
         I'm like, "What about literally anything else?" I did a modern universe
         [inaudible 00:37:49] Please, literally anything
         else.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Other</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world
         and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting,"
         instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with
         it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's
         also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that
         I really was not before.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First of all I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it,
         as a writer. I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's
         beneficial or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it
         now, but I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy.
         I know I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized,
         and I didn't say that obviously in the tags. But I also struggled because I didn't
         know how to write about my own trauma, and so I tried to write about trauma in ways
         that other people were experiencing it. And already the text engaged with that, and
         those weren't really authentic to me. They weren't things I was writing about at the
         time. It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love
         story about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not
         make those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and
         I couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing
         I was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of
         the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was
         more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll
         do alternate points of view."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma. I don't know if I
         thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought about it as a storytelling
         tool obviously that helps power [inaudible 00:17:00], not necessarily about the story
         if it makes sense. I wasn't telling you things that had happened in the past, to teach
         you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This is what's haunting the characters,
         this is what the characters can't escape from in a very physical, visceral fashion."
         Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you know what, I'm okay with it, body
         and mind, if it makes sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon
         compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant,"
         as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant
         sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense
         to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a
         story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine
         that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on
         what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now.
         That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories
         that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And to be fair, omega and alpha as being there in the far right column. I don't really
         understand ABO [alpha, beta, omega] as in general, so I can't talk. They're not as
         inherently sexual. They definitely struck me as relatively sexual, and that's not</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But a few years later when I was, I think,
         13, my friend introduced me to like crack Lord Of The Rings fiction. I had a very
         close group of friends on Live Journal back
         in the early 2000s. That, I think, probably because I was a teenager. Perhaps this
         is because of all those reasons. But that kind of close-knittedness has never kind
         of shown up for me ever since. I think I tend to participate now on more, "Oh, this
         is really interesting for me. And this is really fascinating." And I'll go into it
         for the material as opposed to the friendships themselves. Mostly to keep
         myself writing. Because, otherwise, I would just not publish those materials until
         it becomes, you know. It's basically sitting on my hard drive for years and years
         on
         end, and finally I get the opportunity and the motivation to publish them. Because,
         initially, it was definitely a very close-knit, just writing for friends and with
         friends.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
         the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
         Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
         film." So, the
         person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
         universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending. So then I realized
         that Jodhaa Akbar, which is
         definitely a Desi film, had a wonderful set of characters that was definitely
         angsty, but had a wonderfully happy ending. And allowed me to write about something
         that was kind of dear to my heart as well. Because it was a Desi film. It was one
         representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
         those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
         to bridge them. Because you have to. Because it's not just
         about love, or it's not just about anything. It's about your pride, it's about your
         family's livelihood. All of those kind of come together, you have to do it. You
         don't want to, but, somehow, you have to. I think it's that gritting of your teeth,
         and getting on with life that kind of really draws me in.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it was football RPF
         (real person fic) fanfiction. Which was very interesting, because I think it was
         just after the 2018 World Cup. And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that
         used second person point of
         view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
         you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
         of
         view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
         what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
         more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person. And that also came
         across to a lot of readers, is what
         they were telling me, at least. Because they felt like there was a lot more gravitas
         to the entire fic that you wouldn't see in a lot of my other
         fanfics.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah. I mean, I really do
         feel like there aren't that many second person point of views that kind of allow you
         to immerse yourself into that person, or into that character.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
         was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
         think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
         prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
         I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
         I can sort of tailor it to that," There's been
         a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
         always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
         at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
         art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
         it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
         person's mind."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
         different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
         know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
         way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
         So, I tried to mix it up on occasion. And
         okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
         notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
         figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
         she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
         Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
         things stand out immediately. Even in the modern drabbles, or the
         other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
         she can access that. And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
         gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
         age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
         she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
         life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
         all the time. I loved that. Even if, and I think
         once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
         maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
         to see
         that, but I liked that they
         weren't immediate, for the most part. They wanted to be friends first, but they were
         so good together that I wanted to be able to
         sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes. Things like that, you notice
         immediately, but also that
         it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
         I
         don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
         trying to get portrayed.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
         was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
         possible love interests. Tahno was just a bully that people decide ... I don't
         understand why people like that, but people do. So, we spend four seasons developing
         Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
         lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
         out  immediately after
         the season finale aired, everyone was sort of unsure like, "This is canon, right?
         This is canon. That's what this looks
         like," "Korrasami's canon. That's
         what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
         up to that point, there really hadn't been
         a whole lot of huge representation for female ships. So, these big cartoons that are
         for kids are doing more
         for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
         kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
         much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust." So, to
         see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
         god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
         have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I think with Twilight
         it was just that phase where you finally find a story that speaks to you, even if
         you kind of hate it when you look back at it when you're older. But at the time, how
         Bella was written both as someone who was
         insular and chooses to form or has a small community and so forth and deals with
         depression or whatever it is, it just seemed to be something
         that I could relate to. I think I stumbled
         upon those ... I can't think of what it's called, the English variety, because I did
         stumble upon it in my time in the Indian fan fictions and it was called something
         slightly different. But basically where you would participate with one fan writing
         a
         line, the next fan writing another line and so on and so forth. So that was the
         first time that I actually wrote anything fandom related.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And
         then there was a bit of a lull until my delving into the Indian forums. And there
         we
         would do the meta analysis and satirical writings and so on.  Actually, I completely
         forgot, there was a period where I
         would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because I don't do that
         anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment with writing
         and being critical of source materials and so on. I guess you can say it was a nudge
         to move from passive
         consumption to active consumption.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I started writing and initially my own fan fic, so self insert fan
         fic when I was like maybe about 10 years old. Of course, being
         younger, you don't really understand romance all
         typically well. It's all very idealized. Then as I got older, I
         started liking to delve more into different types of friendships as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
         guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
         to when I came out to them.
         I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
         of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
         having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
         leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
         little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime I wanted to kind of write
         it as like a self-fulfilling
         fantasy as well as like how I would have pictured them actually going through
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>The first big one
         is never write an entire fan fic in Starbucks. I learned how much writing a one shot
         sounds good and all in
         practice, but then it ends up opening all these other doors of should I write more,
         should I write less. I don't know what I should be doing with this. It was
         definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
         back and explore myself with fan
         fic if I needed to as well.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And I actually really liked a
         show called Xena: Warrior Princess. That was kind of my very first fandom. I really
         liked, see I can't even remember now, Ares and Gabrielle. I wrote a fan fiction
         about them that was set in modern times. That was my very first fan
         fic.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It was very short
         and sweet. X-Men. That was the fandom. X-Men comics. And I wrote a story, once
         again, set in modern times. I kind of do this a lot. I take characters out of their
         setting and transpose them into reality. And someone wrote a really detailed review,
         just about
         how, I remember they said they could taste the road dust from my writing. And I was
         like, wow. I never thought of it that way. That's really cool. That kind of inspired
         me to write more, that I could get that emotion out of somebody. They felt like they
         were actually there with them.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because it has to hurt
         if it's to heal.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I like the modern setting. Modern setting seems to be the most
         common one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
         active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
         especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
         and putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>
   </ul>
   </div>


<div class="collapse" id="RGS-angst">
 <h3>Angst</h3>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I guess the first three, they're basic tags. You want to read angst, here's angst.
       You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy
       but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance. And then the last one's a content
       warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see homophobia. I can't not publish a
       story about homophobia.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I don't know, I don't know if I'd use the fluff and angst tags anymore, just because
       I don't talk about my literature in those terms as much anymore, as I used to, but...
       Largely because nobody...You don't use those tags as much anymore in my view, like
       we don't talk about... Those are very much Fanfiction.net-y terms that pulled over,
       I don't see them as I used to. I think that people writing about suffering and happiness,
       a lot of things happen in love stories in general, particularly in WlW and MlM stuff.
       Well, I don't know if MlM, I don't read it very much just because one, I am not a
       man, and two, so much MlM stuff is kind of uncomfortable? A lot it's very clearly
       written by women.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
       clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
       Jon is raised a Targaryen. And it is an angsty fic. It's not like a comedy, there
       is angst.
       And it's one of the major points of the entire fanfic. And the reason I did the Jodhaa
       Akbar tag was actually
       because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
       other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
       fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
       particular tag. I mean, this fic is obviously
       dramatized and all that. But the essential part of it is that both of them have
       this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
       that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
       see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
       very difficult way of going through life. And it's not
       necessarily a happy life that you lead when you have that kind of a
       mentality.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, I think one of
       the major ones is fluff. I mean, you do
       see a lot of angst, though.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
       thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
       in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
       and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
       unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
       me
       try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
       There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
       improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful. The
       "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
       People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
       right there." So I had the "What if." Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
       The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
       right. Ratings may change, warnings may change, series,
       spoilers, all those kind of speak for themselves, just to let you know that okay,
       once again, this isn't static. This is something that changes story by story. Some
       of them may be Gen, some of them, I haven't written one yet, but some of them may
       be
       adult in the future. Some of them may have a lot of violence in them, so just be
       aware. Don't ever come back to this fic and think, "This is what it is." Because
       that's not it. I think my
       characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
       "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
       it may be out of character." Like I said, new fandoms are hard because they
       are. I have a lot of Game of Thrones stuff on the cutting
       room floor, before I decided what to actually post. And there is about 20 other
       drabbles for the one series that haven't made it yet, because I'm one of those
       writers. Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
       that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that Alternate universe, canon
       divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
       want to get blasted on that one. Missandei deserved
       better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
       they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
       would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23]. Fluff and angst, I
       cannot write straight fluff. I'm incapable. You have to have pain with your
       pleasure. I can't do it.</li>
 </ul>
 </div>
 <div class="collapse" id="RGS-fluff"><h3>Fluff</h3>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I guess the first three, they're basic tags. You want to read angst, here's angst.
       You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy
       but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance. And then the last one's a content
       warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see homophobia. I can't not publish a
       story about homophobia.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
       love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
       stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
       of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
       of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
       "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
       who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
       of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, I think one of
       the major ones is fluff. I mean, you do
       see a lot of angst, though.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I like that a lot of people, I still get comments
       occasionally that are, "I've just gone through this whole thing," and you can do
       that. Even though it's 400 chapters, it's book-length. It's like a
       normal book length. It's easily digestible, and each thing's its own thing, so if
       you want to stop it and come back to it later, you can. People do usually, if you're
       feeling a specific mood, and go find that specific one and just go through a couple
       of those. I like that it's sort of, you don't have to have a super amount of
       emotional investment in it, like super long, 10-chapter fics that are 100,000
       words. Like yes, it's very good. I enjoy it. But sometimes, I'm just in
       the mood for something light and I like that I can provide that for people who want
       that. I also like that you can sort of see a progression of
       how I wrote them and how my own skills have maybe, hopefully developed. And even
       just, it did end up being four years' worth of time so it was, when I think I started
       it, Korrasami hadn't
       been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
       And maybe, I think,
       during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
       different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
       strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. Well, absolutely
       part of it was wish fulfillment. I've never been in any sort of relationship, so it
       was like, "Okay, this is might what it be like." But also, I'm a big fan of the fact
       that, of using fanfiction, or TV shows, or movies, or any of that as escapism.
       You look out your window and things are just not
       good a lot of the time,
       so I really like reading things that are just
       soft and maybe things aren't so terrible for them where they are, and just sort
       of getting lost in the idea of, they can just relax. They've been through so
       much, they deserve a little bit of something that's not going to hurt them, with
       somebody who definitely wants the same for them, who wants the same for
       themselves. I tried to make that as a focus. Yeah, I just
       really wanted that.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, again, it was the prompts, but it was
       also, I have personally been a little conflicted on gender for a while, and it's
       like my sexuality, it was something that I sort of just say, "Well, I'll get to
       that when I have the chance." So, it's always just sort of in
       the back of my head I
       try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
       to live with a person she loves, doing
       something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
       complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
       obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
       yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
       be happy. And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
       that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
       most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
       see what they're going through and you see how their lives are,
       and I try not to speak for situations that I've never lived through, but you can
       draw knowledge from that and say, "Okay, well, without going in depth into feelings
       or things like that, I can add this, this, and this, and make it maybe relatable in
       that regard."</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
       serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
       just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
       things that made me super uncomfortable. And it's also, given the
       audience, this is considered a family show. So, I realized over time that maybe I
       don't have to write that. If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
       it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
       press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
       slaves is super ... I didn't want to
       contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
       [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
       more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
       been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
       thing.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
       though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
       for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it. It was
       partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
       Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City, I wanted
       it to, like everything
       else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
       to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it. There's a writer, whose name
       I always mess up. I want to
       say it's coeurdastronaute. They do a lot of Clarke and Lexa
       stuff, but she sets the scene super well with like, "Here's the sky. Here's the
       roads. Here's the this," and I tried to emulate that. And I also wanted to give the
       collection itself a
       sendoff I was proud of. So, I spent a little bit more time on that than I did a lot
       of the other stuff, just let it marinate. "You know what? This is a good end, and
       hope you enjoyed," sort of thing.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
       thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
       in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
       and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
       unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
       me
       try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
       There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
       improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful. The
       "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
       People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
       right there." So I had the "What if." Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
       The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
       right. Ratings may change, warnings may change, series,
       spoilers, all those kind of speak for themselves, just to let you know that okay,
       once again, this isn't static. This is something that changes story by story. Some
       of them may be Gen, some of them, I haven't written one yet, but some of them may
       be
       adult in the future. Some of them may have a lot of violence in them, so just be
       aware. Don't ever come back to this fic and think, "This is what it is." Because
       that's not it. I think my
       characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
       "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
       it may be out of character." Like I said, new fandoms are hard because they
       are. I have a lot of Game of Thrones stuff on the cutting
       room floor, before I decided what to actually post. And there is about 20 other
       drabbles for the one series that haven't made it yet, because I'm one of those
       writers. Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
       that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that Alternate universe, canon
       divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
       want to get blasted on that one. Missandei deserved
       better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
       they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
       would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23]. Fluff and angst, I
       cannot write straight fluff. I'm incapable. You have to have pain with your
       pleasure. I can't do it.</li>

 <div class="collapse" id="RGS-vignette">
 <h3>Vignette</h3>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, it was definitely, when I first started it, it
       was, "Okay, well, I kind of just want to write, and I want to get better at writing,
       practicing it." I started it in college, and the professor I had at that time kept
       saying how, "If you want to get better at writing, you have to write 50,000 words,
       and then, you have to write another 50,000." "Really? All right. I'll just write,
       then. People will give me prompts and I'll just write those as they come in." And
       then, there were a lot of prompts that came in, surprisingly. I was able to stay
       consistent with it for, I want to say, two, three years. And it's funny, going back
       to the original ones, the
       older ones at least, and reading those, because you sent me one. I think it was
       chapter 37 you mentioned in your email, and I went back and read it and I was like,
       "Oof, I could do this a lot better now, I hope." Yeah. Just, I wanted to get better
       at it, and people
       were really good at giving me things that I could easily do at work, I didn't necessarily
       want to
       do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to
       a
       point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
       each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
       all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
       can't."</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I think for
       shorter things, there's a challenge in that you have, I think most of them ended up
       being 200-400 words, so you have to do an entire story in that time. You have to
       make somebody care about things that are happening in much fewer words, and make it
       more impactful in less amount of time. If you have 10,000 words to set up a
       situation and resolve it, and all that, it's definitely different from, "Here's just
       basically a gut punch of a story, and you maybe don't get the whole thing." There's
       a couple that, I don't
       remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
       [inaudible 00:09:21] on purpose, so that it had to be
       like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
       that.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I like that a lot of people, I still get comments
       occasionally that are, "I've just gone through this whole thing," and you can do
       that. Even though it's 400 chapters, it's book-length. It's like a
       normal book length. It's easily digestible, and each thing's its own thing, so if
       you want to stop it and come back to it later, you can. People do usually, if you're
       feeling a specific mood, and go find that specific one and just go through a couple
       of those. I like that it's sort of, you don't have to have a super amount of
       emotional investment in it, like super long, 10-chapter fics that are 100,000
       words. Like yes, it's very good. I enjoy it. But sometimes, I'm just in
       the mood for something light and I like that I can provide that for people who want
       that. I also like that you can sort of see a progression of
       how I wrote them and how my own skills have maybe, hopefully developed. And even
       just, it did end up being four years' worth of time so it was, when I think I started
       it, Korrasami hadn't
       been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
       And maybe, I think,
       during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
       different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
       strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, the fact that
       it was short meant that I did only have a certain amount of words to deal with
       it. So, if there were some things where I'd write the
       original drabble, and then I might get three more immediate requests in my inbox for
       a sequel, or for, "Can I get a full length thing of this?" And I didn't necessarily
       have the time or energy, or just the inclination in some cases. And sometimes, there
       were just
       prompts that were not necessarily things that I wanted to do or actively didn't want
       to do So, I would start to feel guilty, and sometimes
       would just push one out whether or not I felt it was up to par, even though I hoped
       it was.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
       different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
       know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
       way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
       So, I tried to mix it up on occasion. And
       okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
       notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
       figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
       she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
       Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
       things stand out immediately. Even in the modern drabbles, or the
       other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
       she can access that. And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
       gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
       age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
       she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
       life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
       all the time. I loved that. Even if, and I think
       once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
       maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
       to see
       that, but I liked that they
       weren't immediate, for the most part. They wanted to be friends first, but they were
       so good together that I wanted to be able to
       sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes. Things like that, you notice
       immediately, but also that
       it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
       I
       don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
       trying to get portrayed.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because I'm
       a length whore. That's the problem. I get into these fics, and I have these ideas,
       and then they expand out of control, and then I get into a story that's suddenly 30
       chapters long, and then I run out of steam. I'm one of those authors who does kind
       of get bored, and then starts cheating on my fic, which is happening right now in
       Game of Thrones. Let me just zero in on
       the one moment that I think is pivotal, and just kind of get that out, and then
       leave it alone. Because a lot of my drabbles, they are parts of much bigger fics.
       I
       just haven't posted them. That I've actually
       written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
       okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
       alone.</li>
 </ul>

 <div class="collapse" id="RGS-fix">
 <h3>Fix-It</h3>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
       know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Dr. Who episodes is Turn Left. And
       it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
       What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
       And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
       and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
       the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
       that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
       world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
       would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
       maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
       how I got into that.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
       agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
       dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
       that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
       Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
       we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
       that was a little irritating to me. So I wanted
       her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
       supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
       that. I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
       beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
       thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>

 <h3>Author's Note</h3>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I guess the first three, they're basic tags. You want to read angst, here's angst.
       You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy
       but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance. And then the last one's a content
       warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see homophobia. I can't not publish a
       story about homophobia.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>If I remember correctly, this was about writing about suicide. I had been in a fight
       for a very long time. And I was nearly constantly suicidal. And so writing this piece
       was an engaging... It was obviously triggering. It was a piece that was sufficiently
       about me that it would have been fun and helpful for a lot of people. But this, I
       think it was a good piece, it was a piece that was a whole other world to read</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I honestly expected nobody to do
       that. It's good to see that people are just as interested in a lot of it, in this
       stuff. You know? I think that the
       thing I wanted to keep in mind was that I was doing the research, but I was also not
       putting as much research into it as I probably should have if I wanted to make it
       historical fiction. I was literally
       just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
       as
       South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
       Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it. And that was one thing I
       wanted to be clear about.
       Because, yes, it was research. But I think I wanted to keep to the spirit of the
       movie, as well as the spirit of the A Song of Ice and Fire canon. But when I was making
       the
       actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
       actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
       identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
       identify. But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
       and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
       that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
       ideas from. Just building that list kind of helps me know where and how
       I'm getting the material, and the assumptions that I've made throughout the fanfic.
       And, therefore, helps make it easier to kind of discuss it later, I think. I was really
       worried about how it
       would be perceived by the fandom, how it would be received by people even outside
       of
       the fandom. Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
       be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner. So, that was one of the
       primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
       sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
 </ul>
 </div>
 <div class="collapse" id="RGS-bending">
 <h3>Identity Bending</h3>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
       have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
       in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."
       I don't want to be like, "Ah, but I'm writing the version of this character that's
       a woman." I hate that. I know that that's permissible with the meta text but I don't
       want to be part of that. mostly I felt like I wound up just getting in like an extension
       of me arguing on the internet, which is not a super-healthy way of engaging with communities.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I chose to make it Desi because I am Desi. and I wanted
       to experience it. And if you're just starting from scratch, then it's
       difficult to create why two people would hate each other so much. I mean, you need
       to have that religious, and
       cultural, and those barriers in order for that to
       happen. So, I mean, I think the
       choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
       setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
       trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
       for it.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I honestly expected nobody to do
       that. It's good to see that people are just as interested in a lot of it, in this
       stuff. You know? I think that the

       primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
       sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I wrote it in
       one sitting in a Starbucks near my university. It was around the
       time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary and
       I tried to sort of work things out with Jaime as the main focal character You never
       really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
       to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
       with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
       wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
       Jamie and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
       because obviously they wouldn't be having as
       much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
       considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
       day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
       from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
       versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
       wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
       identity. But there would definitely be some push
       back, but how would that change based on the setting?
       I made her a little bit more comfortable in
       her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
       shoulder for Jaime
       who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
       well.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
       way and being very new, if you're very new into
       like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
       a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
       higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
       or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
       You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
       anything. That's definitely
       something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
       of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
       would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
       more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
       me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
       anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
       all of that.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
       reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
       very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
       and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit. I wanted something similar, but
       would still
       make me feel like that, but wanted to make it more intimate and feel like it was
       still just as opening, but with actions and not just with words. trying to work through
       gender things. I
       wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
       their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
       that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
       work through those emotions with me.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
       guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
       to when I came out to them.
       I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
       of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
       having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
       leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
       little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime I wanted to kind of write
       it as like a self-fulfilling
       fantasy as well as like how I would have pictured them actually going through
       it.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>The first big one
       is never write an entire fan fic in Starbucks. I learned how much writing a one shot
       sounds good and all in
       practice, but then it ends up opening all these other doors of should I write more,
       should I write less. I don't know what I should be doing with this. It was
       definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
       back and explore myself with fan
       fic if I needed to as well.</li>
 </ul>
 </div>
 <div class="collapse" id="RGS-modern">
 <h3>Modern Setting</h3>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then
       the fact that the alternate universe for a modern setting is so
       [inaudible 01:07:54]. Which, to me, is very interesting.
       Because I tend to go out of my way to avoid modern alternate universes, because I
       personally don't like them.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I wrote it in
       one sitting in a Starbucks near my university. It was around the
       time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary and
       I tried to sort of work things out with Jaime as the main focal character You never
       really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
       to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
       with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
       wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
       Jamie and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
       because obviously they wouldn't be having as
       much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
       considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
       day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
       from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
       versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
       wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
       identity. But there would definitely be some push
       back, but how would that change based on the setting?
       I made her a little bit more comfortable in
       her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
       shoulder for Jaime
       who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
       well.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I got a very
       interesting response from someone. I believe, maybe a week or two after. They were
       like, "It's a really well written fan fic, it's great, but why in God's (capital G)
       name, did you make Jaime like this?" And the moment I saw capital G, I was like I
       see. I tried to be as cordial as I could and I explained what I said earlier about
       my inspiration from the source material where I wanted to kind of
       explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
       because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
       as well. Yeah, that was the one big kick
       back I got from someone. I was a little bit shocked that I got the capital G person,
       but what can you do?</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
       actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
       how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
       how she had gotten to living with Jaime. I just find their relationship in
       canon to be so interesting because it was one of
       the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
       pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
       surprised. Brienne was what a lot of
       these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
       places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
       and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
       of her issues with not being able
       to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
       heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
       always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
       gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable There's a lot
       of, again, fan fic already out there of
       them being intimate, but it was all
       very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
       vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
       I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
       own instead.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
       way and being very new, if you're very new into
       like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
       a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
       higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
       or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
       You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
       anything. That's definitely
       something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
       of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
       would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
       more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
       me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
       anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
       all of that.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, so at the
       same time I was writing this fan fic, I was writing another one that kind of delved
       into the timeline of how Jaime grew up. It went
       into his relationship with his father, he was caught walking in his mother's red
       heels and he got very scolded and punished for it. I wanted
       to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
       in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
       that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>And then it just kind of gets more
       depressing as it goes on. For some reason, John and Sansa's the most popular ship.
       It's like, I understand that they're not technically related, but I don't get it
       because in the book, they had this very tense relationship and in the show I know
       that they were more around each other. Peytr/Sansa, I want to have some words with
       people. I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
       them, but I
       don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
       just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
       literally right here.
       Renly/Lauris,
       obviously. Sandor and Sansa, I will say that I like their ship name
       as San-San. I do understand the whole
       like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
       romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
       just write a Nora Roberts novel." I'd so read her books if I
       wanted to. I don't need to read them here. Most Game of Thrones fan fic is incredibly
       hetero
       normative and it's a lot of university AU, high school AU and
       I'm like, "What about literally anything else?" I did a modern universe
       [inaudible 00:37:49] Please, literally anything
       else.</li>
 </ul>

 <div class="collapse" id="RGS-other">
 <h3>Other</h3>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world
       and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting,"
       instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with
       it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's
       also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that
       I really was not before.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First of all I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it,
       as a writer. I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's
       beneficial or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it
       now, but I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy.
       I know I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized,
       and I didn't say that obviously in the tags. But I also struggled because I didn't
       know how to write about my own trauma, and so I tried to write about trauma in ways
       that other people were experiencing it. And already the text engaged with that, and
       those weren't really authentic to me. They weren't things I was writing about at the
       time. It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love
       story about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not
       make those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and
       I couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing
       I was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of
       the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was
       more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll
       do alternate points of view."</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma. I don't know if I
       thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought about it as a storytelling
       tool obviously that helps power [inaudible 00:17:00], not necessarily about the story
       if it makes sense. I wasn't telling you things that had happened in the past, to teach
       you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This is what's haunting the characters,
       this is what the characters can't escape from in a very physical, visceral fashion."
       Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you know what, I'm okay with it, body
       and mind, if it makes sense.</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon
       compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant,"
       as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant
       sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense
       to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a
       story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine
       that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on
       what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now.
       That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories
       that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra</li>
    <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And to be fair, omega and alpha as being there in the far right column. I don't really
       understand ABO [alpha, beta, omega] as in general, so I can't talk. They're not as
       inherently sexual. They definitely struck me as relatively sexual, and that's not</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But a few years later when I was, I think,
       13, my friend introduced me to like crack Lord Of The Rings fiction. I had a very
       close group of friends on Live Journal back
       in the early 2000s. That, I think, probably because I was a teenager. Perhaps this
       is because of all those reasons. But that kind of close-knittedness has never kind
       of shown up for me ever since. I think I tend to participate now on more, "Oh, this
       is really interesting for me. And this is really fascinating." And I'll go into it
       for the material as opposed to the friendships themselves. Mostly to keep
       myself writing. Because, otherwise, I would just not publish those materials until
       it becomes, you know. It's basically sitting on my hard drive for years and years
       on
       end, and finally I get the opportunity and the motivation to publish them. Because,
       initially, it was definitely a very close-knit, just writing for friends and with
       friends.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
       the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
       Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
       film." So, the
       person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
       universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending. So then I realized
       that Jodhaa Akbar, which is
       definitely a Desi film, had a wonderful set of characters that was definitely
       angsty, but had a wonderfully happy ending. And allowed me to write about something
       that was kind of dear to my heart as well. Because it was a Desi film. It was one
       representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
       those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
       to bridge them. Because you have to. Because it's not just
       about love, or it's not just about anything. It's about your pride, it's about your
       family's livelihood. All of those kind of come together, you have to do it. You
       don't want to, but, somehow, you have to. I think it's that gritting of your teeth,
       and getting on with life that kind of really draws me in.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it was football RPF
       (real person fic) fanfiction. Which was very interesting, because I think it was
       just after the 2018 World Cup. And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that
       used second person point of
       view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
       you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
       of
       view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
       what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
       more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person. And that also came
       across to a lot of readers, is what
       they were telling me, at least. Because they felt like there was a lot more gravitas
       to the entire fic that you wouldn't see in a lot of my other
       fanfics.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah. I mean, I really do
       feel like there aren't that many second person point of views that kind of allow you
       to immerse yourself into that person, or into that character.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
       was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
       think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
       prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
       I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
       I can sort of tailor it to that," There's been
       a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
       always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
       at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
       art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
       it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
       person's mind."</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
       different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
       know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
       way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
       So, I tried to mix it up on occasion. And
       okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
       notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
       figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
       she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
       Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
       things stand out immediately. Even in the modern drabbles, or the
       other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
       she can access that. And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
       gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
       age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
       she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
       life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
       all the time. I loved that. Even if, and I think
       once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
       maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
       to see
       that, but I liked that they
       weren't immediate, for the most part. They wanted to be friends first, but they were
       so good together that I wanted to be able to
       sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes. Things like that, you notice
       immediately, but also that
       it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
       I
       don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
       trying to get portrayed.</li>
    <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
       was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
       possible love interests. Tahno was just a bully that people decide ... I don't
       understand why people like that, but people do. So, we spend four seasons developing
       Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
       lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
       out  immediately after
       the season finale aired, everyone was sort of unsure like, "This is canon, right?
       This is canon. That's what this looks
       like," "Korrasami's canon. That's
       what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
       up to that point, there really hadn't been
       a whole lot of huge representation for female ships. So, these big cartoons that are
       for kids are doing more
       for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
       kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
       much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust." So, to
       see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
       god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
       have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I think with Twilight
       it was just that phase where you finally find a story that speaks to you, even if
       you kind of hate it when you look back at it when you're older. But at the time, how
       Bella was written both as someone who was
       insular and chooses to form or has a small community and so forth and deals with
       depression or whatever it is, it just seemed to be something
       that I could relate to. I think I stumbled
       upon those ... I can't think of what it's called, the English variety, because I did
       stumble upon it in my time in the Indian fan fictions and it was called something
       slightly different. But basically where you would participate with one fan writing
       a
       line, the next fan writing another line and so on and so forth. So that was the
       first time that I actually wrote anything fandom related.</li>
    <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And
       then there was a bit of a lull until my delving into the Indian forums. And there
       we
       would do the meta analysis and satirical writings and so on.  Actually, I completely
       forgot, there was a period where I
       would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because I don't do that
       anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment with writing
       and being critical of source materials and so on. I guess you can say it was a nudge
       to move from passive
       consumption to active consumption.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I started writing and initially my own fan fic, so self insert fan
       fic when I was like maybe about 10 years old. Of course, being
       younger, you don't really understand romance all
       typically well. It's all very idealized. Then as I got older, I
       started liking to delve more into different types of friendships as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
       guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
       to when I came out to them.
       I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
       of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
       having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
       leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
       little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime I wanted to kind of write
       it as like a self-fulfilling
       fantasy as well as like how I would have pictured them actually going through
       it.</li>
    <li><strong>Valk: </strong>The first big one
       is never write an entire fan fic in Starbucks. I learned how much writing a one shot
       sounds good and all in
       practice, but then it ends up opening all these other doors of should I write more,
       should I write less. I don't know what I should be doing with this. It was
       definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
       back and explore myself with fan
       fic if I needed to as well.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And I actually really liked a
       show called Xena: Warrior Princess. That was kind of my very first fandom. I really
       liked, see I can't even remember now, Ares and Gabrielle. I wrote a fan fiction
       about them that was set in modern times. That was my very first fan
       fic.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It was very short
       and sweet. X-Men. That was the fandom. X-Men comics. And I wrote a story, once
       again, set in modern times. I kind of do this a lot. I take characters out of their
       setting and transpose them into reality. And someone wrote a really detailed review,
       just about
       how, I remember they said they could taste the road dust from my writing. And I was
       like, wow. I never thought of it that way. That's really cool. That kind of inspired
       me to write more, that I could get that emotion out of somebody. They felt like they
       were actually there with them.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because it has to hurt
       if it's to heal.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I like the modern setting. Modern setting seems to be the most
       common one.</li>
    <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
       active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
       especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
       and putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>
