   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Because I just find keeping people as slaves is super ... I didn't want to
         contribute to it</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>good that
         nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
         communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
         white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
         frankly.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So when I first read texts were people
         were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living
         in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et
         cetera.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>because back home I was part of the
         majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing yourself in other
         ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in the news as a
         politician, et cetera</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>both as a black person and as a woman, it was
         just important for me to recognize that in text and get around to exploring what
         that might have meant for other characters who weren't within the Circle of the
         Avatar and had powerful connections.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> dating a
         black man, or having that black man being put as a love interest when that's
         usually not the case, especially for that kind of media.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
         away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
         one thing that would be important to her?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't know if I was a former slave. The one thing I
         would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
         in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
         into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
         anymore.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
         better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
         they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
         would.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>she believes in a world
         without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
         something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
         times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
         I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
         to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
         think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
         sentiment.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
         be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
         be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And for her of course it's more extreme,
         from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
         decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
         getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
         found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
         myself.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>it
         was talking about how former slaves, they go through this process of not believing
         that they're free, and not believing that they're free, and not believing that
         they're free. And eventually, they get to a
         point where it sticks in their head, that this is freedom. This is what they
         have. No one can control them. And then, they get very, very almost violently
         independent, where no one's going to tell me what to do. You can't tell me what
         to do. No one's going to do that to me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>They get this burst of a sense of self, a
         sense of purpose. And I thought that was very beautiful, that there are people
         who can go through all that type of trauma, and they can get there, and they can
         fully bloom. And I always saw Missandei as kind of that character, this
         character who had gone through all of that to the point where here she is,
         standing tall as a character that knows her own worth, knows her own
         personage.</li>

  <h2>Power & Identity: Racism</h2>
  <div class="interview-search-analysis">
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors mention racism or racist statements in fan communities, fanfiction, and the canonical materials. Racism here specifically refers to power differentials between different races and how race is a culturally constructed way of identifying, marking, and reading bodies. Forms of racism include white supremacy, the erasure of diverse races/ethnicities, discriminatory behaviors towards a particular race (specifically people of color), and assuming whiteness as the norm.

     <ul>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Given this is a proportion, I don't know if [inaudible 00:57:24] but more people as
           a fandom and those few people aren't interested in talking about race in ways that
           people who had been there before were, and those people who were there before continued
           to talk about race, or if there is an effectively gentrifying mmoment that a white
           fandom comes in, pushes out a fandom of color.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
           be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
           Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on
           South America but as socially, politically part of the Caribbean, so most of the
           content that we were consuming was either shows from the US or whatever, maybe
           European shows might have filtered through, and that also was the case for the
           books that we were reading. And while it was the case within school for us to
           consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to read Caribbean literature as a
           person on my own.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And my aunt in particular, she
           teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
           them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
           were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
           know. </li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But here it was a completely different
           ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because even when
           you talk about what characters are bound to get more attention and more
           interesting and so on and so forth, when you look at fandom in general you'll
           find that when those characters are black or just generally a person of color in
           comparison to a character being white, that people are least particular when the
           fandom's dominated by white faces and so forth. They are more likely to explore
           those characters and to humanize them and to want to get to know them better,
           while other characters and what their hopes and dreams and ideas might be for
           the world are pushed to the side.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>even
           to the point where they used the black character as a wedge between
           them</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And we are
           going to have your favorite superhero be shipped with a slave
           owner.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And then you break them apart in the
           second season and conveniently replace him with a white man who just actually
           makes the character feel terrible</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It pissed me
           off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
           slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
           did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
           white women.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Mostly she seems to almost
           be absent from things. She's window dressing. She's there, she doesn't speak, or she
           speaks, it's one or two sentences in the entire fic.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>you get those fics where she
           either has none of those, she's either not there, or she has really none of those
           attributes. She's kind of just a yes person. Yes, Khaleesi, no Khaleesi, yes my
           queen.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because there aren't really a lot of
           fics that focus on her as a character at all.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
           seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
           woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
           anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
           back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
           Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
           slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
           she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
           jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
           great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
           I've seen it before.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>No, you
           would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
           think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
           better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
           are not. You are exactly like them</li>

     <ul>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I remember coming away with this feeling that there is a marginalized subjectivity
           in the Northern Water Tribe. And so telling this story about difference in culture</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Basically that I think Korra's upbringing is particularly reflective of that culture,
           yeah.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>"This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy that there's not homophobia in a world
           with gender in the like weird way that... In ways that still reflect our I think gender
           and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the way that we have a sense of gender. Big,
           capital G Gender. And so I thought like, "What does it mean to have culture in the
           context of... What does it mean to be a cosmopolitan city where... There's both a
           degree of marginalization for like the Northern Water Tribe closing... Not so much
           that rules that are really intended to enforce gender norms are going to be there.
           And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a different understanding of gender in
           context," yeah.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
           progressive father.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy understanding of
           the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a woman can love another
           woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows. This is nothing like,
           Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that institution itself.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because it was a Desi film. It was one
           representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
           those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
           to bridge them.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, you need to have that religious, and
           cultural, and those barriers in order for that to
           happen.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, of course, you have the Targaryen
           colors, which are black, which are mourning colors according to the Western
           culture. </li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Where I
           just didn't translate them into Rajput or Hindi words. Because I just use
           whatever I knew, because I speak Kannada at home.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well as
           South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
           Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because it's also your
           culture. You know what you're doing, you know where you're coming from. But we
           would not do it." And, I mean, the vast majority of them were from the U.K. or
           the U.S., and they were not from the same culture.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I was also combining both South Indian and North Indian tropes, to a
           certain extent. And those weren't necessarily very compatible. And there's a lot
           of history behind that and everything.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because especially when you're looking at a lot of Indian mothers, and Indian
           women who get into marriages at a very young age. You have to deal with your
           husband's family, you have to deal with that entire kind of stigma. About you
           have to be the one to adjust and to compromise to a far greater extent than your
           husband.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Where she was
           just trying to fight it, she was such a perfect child in that culture. And then
           suddenly she has to kind of leave her culture behind. Or, not leave her culture
           behind, but adjust to a new culture.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>you
           actually get more of a cultural tension due to just the difference between the
           North and the South. And all of that. And I do think that George R. R. Martin
           has kind of perpetuated the idea, simply because he is English. So, the whole
           idea that in England, where Northerners are tougher and everything than
           Southerners. And I don't know anything more about it. But I think that's kind of
           one of the underlying and unconscious biases within the framework of the
           canon.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Especially that religious tension between Jon and
           Sansa. And have that difference, where both of them and neither of them are
           willing to compromise on that.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I mean, there are
           cultural differences within, I mean, people that I've grown up with in India,
           and people in the U.S. And even though you're living side by side, that doesn't
           necessarily mean that you have the same cultural background.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, I mean, we don't know if she relies more on
           her religion because she left her homeland, and came to the North. And just
           wanted some desperate way, something to rely on that's her family, or that
           reminded her of home. But to me, at least, I can imagine, especially the actual
           Jodhaa, going to Akbar's Islamic court. And basically being all alone, and not
           having very many allies. And finding some sort of a solace in her religion of
           Hinduism.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because as much as she's giving him the gift,
           she's also giving him his name. And she's stepping across her own cultural
           boundaries to help him with that, which Jon doesn't completely
           understand.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong> And adjusting to that
           is a huge, almost, culture shock to people.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And has to go to a foreign country without any
           support, and any of her own traditions. She's the one that's upheld every single
           tradition she has ever done. And especially when you're looking at the Hindu
           culture, it's very difficult to uphold them.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
           watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
           because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
           and so on.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I got into forums and fans would
           translate for those of us who didn't speak Hindi.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>it was kind of taboo for
           divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
           portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
           it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I grew up in a country
           where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian content was part of our
           regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened, so it shaped what I was
           interested in.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on
           South America but as socially, politically part of the Caribbean, so most of the
           content that we were consuming was either shows from the US or whatever, maybe
           European shows might have filtered through, and that also was the case for the
           books that we were reading. And while it was the case within school for us to
           consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to read Caribbean literature as a
           person on my own.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And my aunt in particular, she
           teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
           them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
           were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
           know. </li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So when I first read texts were people
           were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living

           cetera.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because even though I speak, let's say,
           like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
           home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
           speak English, but it's a particular kind of English.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>because back home I was part of the
           majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing yourself in other
           ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in the news as a
           politician, et cetera</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But here it was a completely different
           ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> Given my own cultural background and
           the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
           that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I mean, I know I was raised
           in a pretty fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing

     <h3>Quotes</h3>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It's a piece about about trauma... And it [inaudible 00:05:20], that this isn't obviously.
           It's a piece about trauma and it's a piece about, what does it mean... Really they're
           both pieces about what it means to be disabled.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong> also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just very surface, very basic understanding
           of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something you recover from, in a way that I
           was not super comfortable with. And sort of the original text, not sure if you would
           agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability through the context of being something
           you come to live with, and come to integrate, and come to find becomes a part of you
           life, but also something you still struggle with, instead of just, I don't know, a
           lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you get better, and then you get better
           and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother you.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it, as a writer.
           I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's beneficial
           or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it now, but
           I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy. I know
           I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized, and
           I didn't say that obviously in the tags.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
           I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
           already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
           weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
           about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
           those two pieces meld at the time.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because
           I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wasn't telling you things that had happened in the past, to teach you what happened
           in the past. I was saying, "This is what's haunting the characters, this is what the
           characters can't escape from in a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical
           might be the wrong word, you know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes
           sense.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was trying to write a story that engaged with trauma and felt authentic and didn't
           make trauma seem like the end of the world. Because the binary that's in a lot of
           literature is either like, "Oh, you either overcame trauma, or you are doomed to misery
           forever." And I was trying to find some middle ground, trying to tell a story that
           felt authentic.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
           her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
           Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
           is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
           dress herself.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>it's not really about romance as much as it is about feeling connected in a genuine
           way to people, that that central theme, building a life worth living after injury,
           or after trauma, is finding an authentic realtionship with people.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>because Korra's definitely, she's
           traumatized.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>she's trying to have a good experience and maybe power
           through it, but then, in that brief lapse where she forgets that she's tied down
           and then she tries to sit up, it's sort of like a muscle memory thing, where
           she's back there the last time she was chained up and couldn't
           move.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
           Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
           small community and so forth and deals with depression</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>we get to see Korra, who is
           this all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having
           this really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once
           had, and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to
           deal with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so
           forth.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's just different for me.
           Deal with PTSD and depression and just all these changing
           things.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't want to say broken, but be injured in a
           really drastic way and them not being able to do anything much to help with her
           recovery in concrete ways.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>to be someone who builds and creates
           with the purpose of fixing or making better, but then not being able to do so for
           someone within your personal life.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>when I was writing, I wasn't very well-versed in
           not just having a limb missing as a disability, but also how advanced the
           prosthetics were and if they could hold things</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I would definitely
           want to go more into his disability as well as his prosthetic and how it worked
           more.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually had to do a bit of
           research on some of the fic, for things like trauma, and how people respond to
           trauma. Especially in the case of Sansa and Missandei, how do people overcome
           certain difficulties after being in these different positions?</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, mostly
           it was Googling, recovering from trauma. I did a little bit of research on former
           slaves, to see their mindset.</li>

     <h3>Quotes</h3>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>"I can't really write this story about two women in love because one of them isn't
           a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
           context around Stonewall,</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
           about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
           those two pieces meld at the time.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love feeling represented."</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong> And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about is to write about... Not
           just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia, not just homophobia,
           but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because this was the thing
           that was radicalizing me</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Asami plays that role, being a person to whom Korra wants to relate, is thrilled to
           relate, is not scared, or she is a little bit scared to relate, but is she scared
           to relate in the way that she's scared to relate to other people.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy understanding of
           the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a woman can love another
           woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows. This is nothing like,
           Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that institution itself.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
           a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
           but it's good.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And there's a degree to which it a queer reading, there's this political tendency
           to look at fiction and say, "I am going to tell the story you didn't."</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
           love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
           stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
           of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
           of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
           "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
           who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
           of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that people writing about suffering and happiness, a lot of things happen
           in love stories in general, particularly in WlW and MlM stuff.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was laughing at the bottom set for heiress in the middle column, "a-asami" there.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>It's very interesting to me, because I think if you look at any other major
           fandom, you would probably get male male slash at a much higher rate than you're
           getting here.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> at least all three are those are canonically queer
           characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
           go,</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And maybe, I think,
           during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
           different attitudes in that.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>just
           seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
           once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
           not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
           the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
           there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>let's just
           focus on these two.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>As soon as Asami showed up on the screen, I must have lost
           it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
           happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so I really like reading things that are just
           soft and maybe things aren't so terrible for them where they are, and just sort
           of getting lost in the idea of, they can just relax. They've been through so
           much, they deserve a little bit of something that's not going to hurt them, with
           somebody who definitely wants the same for them, who wants the same for
           themselves.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I liked that they
           weren't immediate, for the most part.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>but they were so good together that I wanted to be able to
           sometimes just say they can be immediate,</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
           it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
           since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
           until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
           a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
           decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
           this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
           case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
           Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
           bit.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, again, it was the prompts, but it was
           also, I have personally been a little conflicted on gender for a while, and it's
           like my sexuality, it was something that I sort of just say, "Well, I'll get to
           that when I have the chance."</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>she's living the life that she wanted to live with a person she loves, doing
           something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
           complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
           obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
           that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
           most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
           see what they're going through and you see how their lives are</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
           care whether or not they necessarily gel."</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"That's a little gayer than it maybe should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
           of people took that and decided to go with it</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>or at least Korrasami fans, picking
           up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
           so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
           happen."</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>This is canon, right? This is canon. That's what this looks
           like</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>especially since, up to that point, there really hadn't been
           a whole lot of huge representation for female ships.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> Given my own cultural background and
           the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
           that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I wasn't
           quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
           to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
           community.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I just, spending so much time reading so much fanfiction
           from LOK and then branching out into Steven Universe and moving
           from Steven Universe into Supergirl, there was
           just more of an interaction with another side of fandom, the slash side of
           fandom. I don't know. I think you have to be integrated with others who are
           looking for more than what's presented, looking for more than what's norm,
           what's the acceptable way of telling a story of any kind of relationship really.
           </li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I was like, "Okay. This is pretty blatant. I
           don't see how anyone is not seeing this."</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I mean, I know I was raised
           in a pretty fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing
           here things that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
           00:58:53] people."</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>some people who are cishet won't be able to speak to
           this</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>two
           actors leaning into it because they didn't have a problem with
           it</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
           to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
           bi-sexual.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I was putting them on paper, using another
           character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
           where I felt I was kind of safe to do so.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
           show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
           just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
           not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
           female-female relationships as well</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was around the
           time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I sort of delved into this idea trying to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
           with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
           wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive shoulder for Jaime
           who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
           well.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>my own experiences, just exploring the LGBT
           community in my area</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I really wanted
           to address the gender issue and the gender questioning and write how the
           experiences hit the hardest for me when I was thinking about
           it.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>if you're very new into
           like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
           a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
           higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
           or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
           You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
           anything.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
           wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
           their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
           that would fit them better or explore better.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
           of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
           having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
           leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
           little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of write it as like a self-fulfilling
           fantasy as well as like how I would have pictured them actually going through
           it.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>knowing that I could go back and explore myself with fan
           fic if I needed to as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I ship Sansa and Margaery and I tried to write fic for
           them</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Renly/Lauris,
           obviously.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>We just did that, like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
           and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
           interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
           dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
           front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
           interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
           not try and put this away.</li>

     <h3>Quotes</h3>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
           love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
           stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
           of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
           of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
           "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
           who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
           of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>To any women, adjusting to that is
           difficult.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Which is, "Yes, I'm miserable. I want you to be miserable. But how am I going
           to be miserable for?" You need to let some things go, you need to move on past
           the injustices... I need to move past the injustices that I have
           faced.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Or, she's feeling as if her family is not willing to give
           her as much as she is owed when she's going into a
           marriage.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>when I was first getting into the fandom,
           one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
           strong.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Like, you have Sansa, who
           is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
           of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
           conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
           world.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
           child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
           sure that nobody hurt her.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think
           there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
           liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
           everything.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>that they have
           very female-centered stories.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> And for Korra, she's an imposing
           figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>it was kind of taboo for
           divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
           portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
           it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess in the power fantasy that she was written to
           come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
           characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>both as a black person and as a woman, it was
           just important for me to recognize that in text and get around to exploring what
           that might have meant for other characters who weren't within the Circle of the
           Avatar and had powerful connections.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular,
           I think it's fascinating that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all
           these really powerful girl and women characters who were, for the most part,
           respected, at least in later years.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So it was
           interesting to see all these female characters get to be complex and powerful
           and not have that held against them,</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>we have Korra, who is the avatar, and she is this
           figure who is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity
           that we're accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants
           without concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think
           about her gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering
           herself inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this
           particular form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin
           and we see Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or
           they're dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with
           their mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well,
           if they do have children, and so forth.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korra is an avatar who's a
           woman.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's basically girl-next-door, blonde, blue-eyed, sort of
           hyper-feminine in some ways but also gender non-conforming in other ways super
           hero</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>obviously they wouldn't be having as
           much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
           considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
           day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
           from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
           versa.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I made her a little bit more comfortable in
           her skin than Jaime</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
           own instead.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>he always had a very strange affinity, but
           like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
           loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
           of view.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Jaime had this big, beautiful wife that was taller than him
           and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
           wonderful?"</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>willing to not listen to him, who
           understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
           manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
           only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
           run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
           ends are."</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
           agency.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So I wanted
           her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
           supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
           that.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>that's my choice. But it won't be going back
           to a ruined Winterfell to marry a legitimized bastard.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>he would never allow that, because he
           wants control of her, and that is something that she realizes, because she's not
           an idiot.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's re-discovered her strength. She's
           done something that she didn't think she could do.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was kind of that whole, what that
           episode was about was Sansa really re-discovering herself, and what she could
           do.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So really, Sansa's really forced to grow up,
           and she's really forced to see all these stories as exactly what they are.
           They're just stories.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>What I was afraid of, I should never have
           been afraid of, what I wanted was the thing I should have been worried about.
           She's really kind of flipped the script in her own mind.</li>

     <ul>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>"I can't really write this story about two women in love because one of them isn't
           a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>"This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy that there's not homophobia in a world
           with gender in the like weird way that... In ways that still reflect our I think gender
           and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the way that we have a sense of gender. Big,
           capital G Gender. And so I thought like, "What does it mean to have culture in the
           context of... What does it mean to be a cosmopolitan city where... There's both a
           degree of marginalization for like the Northern Water Tribe closing... Not so much
           that rules that are really intended to enforce gender norms are going to be there.
           And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a different understanding of gender in
           context," yeah.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I'm really interested in the fact that Korra and Mako becomes more common after Korrasami
           happened.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>you're seeing is a movement from seeing the word girlfriend in a context of a text
           that's about a set of texts about relationships in a more heterosexual perspective,
           in a story about women. Because it looks to me that this is a story that, if you see
           jealous there, that looks like I'm looking at a piece that's from Korra's point of
           view. But then if I'm looking at boyfriend, I'm also thinking about Korra and Mako.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>just looking at masculinity as almost sexual in the middle there, an almost dangerous.
           Because a person's understanding of masculinity are sexual, like the second one is
           a kind of dangerous, like a kind of danger</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Versus like the sexuality in the second one, for feminine as well as that same panel,
           but it's not like dangerous</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it's just very interesting to me to
           see how female male has been so prevalent across all seasons. And to such an
           extent. And, I mean, obviously, there are a lot of theories about why that
           is</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
           I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
           make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
           heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
           fandoms.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
           super forced</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Initially, it was definitely harder to see
           that</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>the easy answer is sexism,
           because everyone sees the main heroine next to a cute boy and decides, "That's
           good. I'm going to do that," without maybe necessarily putting much more thought
           into it.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>A lot of
           straight people I know will look at a lot of these relationships and say, "Oh,
           that came from nowhere."</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>it was kind of taboo for
           divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
           portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
           it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I wasn't
           quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
           to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
           community.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>She's not a dainty fainting
           flower that they love.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> At the time, I don't know, it was just that Korra
           and Mako were what was the norm. And so I think it made sense for some people to
           only be able to see that happening. I mean, I didn't see the possibility of
           Korrasami until the very end.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Plus the allocishets tend to dominate
           fandom in general, so it made sense that they would sort of own the sandbox and
           everyone else should be playing to the side.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>couldn't quite bring
           themselves to see what others were seeing when they took the allocishet glasses
           off.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I'm always on the fence sometimes when I'm talking
           about how people are seeing or not seeing certain things. Because even with my
           current fandom, it's like half the people are saying that we're delusional or
           creating things where there aren't things. And then other times you see these
           exact phenomena occurring in cishet media.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>because a lot of the media already does a lot of
           the male-female exploration.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong> lot of their fics also had a lot of like Jaime
           being the man and Brienne finally being able to let her guard
           down.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>it was all
           very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
           vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It went
           into his relationship with his father, he was caught walking in his mother's red
           heels and he got very scolded and punished for it.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I do understand the whole
           like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
           romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
           just write a Nora Roberts novel."</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Most Game of Thrones fanfic is incredibly hetero
           normative </li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Again, it's Renly/Lauris,
           Sansa/Margaery. Yeah, there's not a lot really on there.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
           less fanfic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
           unique friendship/relationship</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>the show really undercut Jaime and Brienne's
           relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
           kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong> lot of
           the fics, even with Jaime and Brienne is just depressingly, like, "Wow, if I
           wanted to read this fic, I'd just go to like any romance section and find
           it."</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>wonderful knights in their shining armor, these
           lovely ladies who are just ethereal in their beauty, everything being wrapped up
           in a bow, happily ever after. Maybe something happens, but someone's always
           rescued.</li>

        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>if you read this you'll see homophobia. I can't not publish a story about homophobia.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong> And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about is to write about... Not
           just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia, not just homophobia,
           but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because this was the thing
           that was radicalizing me</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I remember being like, "Oh, these folks are not going to tell a child about queer
           sexuality." Particularly sexuality is a hard topic, you grow up in that kind of compound
           in a world where queer identities are looked down on, you're going to come away with
           this very strange view about that. And you might just be told nothing.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community college
           is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of people
           that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't talk
           about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
           that was the only source of information.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water
           Tribe, or is not criminalized anymore.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>turns out the book I was reading at the time that claimed that knowing someone who
           was gay had a significant...Or not knowing someone who was gay, but engaging with
           someone who's gay on the topic of being gay helped significantly with changing someone's
           political views, or being willing to accept gay people. Turns out that one was actually
           wrong, like literally the person who put together that study cooked the book.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong> was thinking about New York City around the times of the Stonewall Riots. This is
           where those politics come in. I was playing with, what does it mean... I was playing
           with, what's particularly violent political oppression? What are the limits of political
           oppression in a relatively liberal cosmopolitan society?</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And maybe, I think,
           during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
           different attitudes in that.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>A lot of
           straight people I know will look at a lot of these relationships and say, "Oh,
           that came from nowhere."</li>

           just seemed like the safer option at the time. </li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korrasami just seems too weird,
           okay people.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think they got uncomfortable with how fandom
           was growing so rapidly and intensely around these two
           characters</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>but we see that some of the writers were
           uncomfortable, or I guess maybe the network or the showrunners were
           uncomfortable where the story was heading.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>gender fluid and gender
           related things, it wasn't really there.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
           guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
           to when I came out to them.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
           don't know why it never picked up. Margaery just walked around the whole show
           just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
           literally right here.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Again, it's Renly/Lauris,
           Sansa/Margaery. Yeah, there's not a lot really on there.</li>

     <ul>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because especially when you're looking at a lot of Indian mothers, and Indian
           women who get into marriages at a very young age. You have to deal with your
           husband's family, you have to deal with that entire kind of stigma. About you
           have to be the one to adjust and to compromise to a far greater extent than your
           husband.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Which is, "Yes, I'm miserable. I want you to be miserable. But how am I going
           to be miserable for?" You need to let some things go, you need to move on past
           the injustices... I need to move past the injustices that I have
           faced.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>the easy answer is sexism,
           because everyone sees the main heroine next to a cute boy and decides, "That's
           good. I'm going to do that," without maybe necessarily putting much more thought
           into it.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But even Katara in the beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use
           waterbending beyond healing</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> derails her show, and starts to get almost as much screen
           time as she does even though he's not really an integral part of the show. Just
           so much went wrong so fast. He was so bad.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>But there would definitely be some push
           back,</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think that reflected a lot of her issues with not being able
           to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
           heir, giving him a son and all these things.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Residual toxic masculinity and
           all of that.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>the show really undercut Jaime and Brienne's
           relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
           kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
           we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
           that was a little irritating to me.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I always thought he kind of saw her,
           especially in the beginning as, he called her a little bird. Like, "I see that your
           parents never prepared you for this. Your best safe kept in a cage locked away, and
           you
           can just sing to people."</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
           and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
           stalker-y.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Petyr would relish that. He
           does everything he can to get her into trusting him, and thinking of him as her
           friend, and I would do anything for you, and that's really, really creepy. It's
           always a surprise to me when I see Petyr Baelish, Sansa Stark fics especially
           ones where it's not manipulative, and coercive, and creepy, I'm like, "What are
           you guys seeing in that?" That's just odd.</li>

     <h3>Quotes</h3>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I guess it was actually about immigration, it's just I never really ever got around
           to doing a piece about immigration system, but somebody had a bad take about immigration
           in America in a piece of fanfic and I was like, "God, that's a really bad understanding
           of that friend. That is utopian and wrong."</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it, as a writer.
           I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's beneficial
           or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it now, but
           I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy. I know
           I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized, and
           I didn't say that obviously in the tags.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because
           I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And it was about violence, so I don't just mean violence as a method of resistance,
           I mean violence as a thing that people survive.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But also a man who genuinely is providing aid and comfort and resources for fighting
           for what he views as liberation, and that liberation's probably genuine at some level.
           I think it's fair to say that there is a political bender-like supremacy at the beginning.
           I mean there is, we know there's a bender supremacy at the beginning of The Legend
           of Korra.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give
           up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>You could do what, when and where, the idea that a politician can't really save the
           world. I don't know if I was all the way to, "We have to do it," yet, but I think
           I'm getting there.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This was written obviously before Donald Trump becomes President, and I could see
           all sorts of things about reaction again. But I was seeing the reaction, I was scared.
           I don't know where I got this, there was something bad was coming. I knew that I had
           that sense of fear, so I was writing about... I guess writing a little bit about,
           how do we fight back when things get worse?</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I'd write it as a story that talks about immigration, and talks about sweeping panic
           and fear that spill off of that. I'd probably talk about gender through those lenses,
           and I'd probably talk about humanity in a slightly more complex... I'd probably make
           it a story that... I'd probably both use modern messages to say that, I'd probably
           talk more about police state, and police state as endless spying networks where you
           don't know when you're being spied on and when you're not, and endless police states</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong> so much MlM stuff is kind of uncomfortable? A lot it's very clearly written by women.</li>
        <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't really understand ABO [alpha, beta, omega] as in general, so I can't talk.
           They're not as inherently sexual. They definitely struck me as relatively sexual</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong> But it was, I
           think, mostly due to the kind of deep rage that I was feeling over the entire
           Democratic Primaries over the past couple of months. And almost the past year.
           In which everything felt very much like a lot of talk, and not a lot of doing.
           And at some point, you need some catharsis. And kind of putting it out into
           fiction and seeing something changing. Or, not even seeing something changing.
           But seeing people trying to effect change, and willing to fight for that change
           felt very important to me. And basically that entire fanfic is kind of born out
           of that seething, massive, "I want to see something happening."</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>From either my own culture because, of course,
           this is partially my own culture.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
           that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
           see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
           very difficult way of going through life.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>it's a common trope in a lot of fanfiction communities, is the student-teacher
           ... What is that? Student-teacher pairing, whatever. My dad is a teacher, so the
           idea of that has always just absolutely not been something that I want to
           encourage, and it just isn't good, so I don't like writing that, I don't like
           reading it.</li>
        <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>You look out your window and things are just not
           good a lot of the time,</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>how these shows and books and games et cetera were failing us, whether it
           was in terms of the content or the representation or just releasing new things like
           thought arcs that weren't followed through on.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because even though I speak, let's say,
           like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
           home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
           speak English, but it's a particular kind of English.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
           not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
           audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
           exploration. </li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
           guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
           for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
           act of violence ...</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I think that's my favorite thing about fandom
           and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
           either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
           enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
           in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
           world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
           through.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think,
           and I'll probably go with my own fandom experiences, it just comes back to how
           the world is constructed externally. So just even the idea of imagining inside
           of what was placed before us, it takes a special kind of familiarity with the
           boarders of the world to imagine a world that is different from what is
           presented to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>that people were so willing to see all these other,
           in some ways really twisted, relationship dynamics,</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>you don't really understand romance all
           typically well. It's all very idealized.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>it was one of
           the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
           pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
           surprised.</li>
        <li><strong>Valk: </strong>A lot of incest. An exorbitant amount of
           incest, like beyond what I even take it. I'm typically very do what you want,
           but even now, I'm just like don't like that.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>willing to not listen to him, who
           understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
           manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
           only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
           run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
           ends are."</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>he would never allow that, because he
           wants control of her, and that is something that she realizes, because she's not
           an idiot.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
           seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
           woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
           anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
           back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
           Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
           slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
           she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
           jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
           great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
           I've seen it before.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
           that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
           be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
           be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually had to do a bit of
           research on some of the fic, for things like trauma, and how people respond to
           trauma. Especially in the case of Sansa and Missandei, how do people overcome
           certain difficulties after being in these different positions?</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, mostly
           it was Googling, recovering from trauma. I did a little bit of research on former
           slaves, to see their mindset.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then with Sansa, just how people recover
           from abusive and traumatic relationships, and things like that. The stages of
           recovery.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually liked
           Sandor Clegane, Sansa Stark as a pairing, whether it's through platonic, whether
           it's romantic, et cetera.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
           and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
           stalker-y.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Sansa, Petyr, I've always hated that one, simply because he's grooming. It's
           very obvious.</li>
        <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Petyr would relish that. He
           does everything he can to get her into trusting him, and thinking of him as her
           friend, and I would do anything for you, and that's really, really creepy. It's
           always a surprise to me when I see Petyr Baelish, Sansa Stark fics especially
           ones where it's not manipulative, and coercive, and creepy, I'm like, "What are
           you guys seeing in that?" That's just odd.</li>
