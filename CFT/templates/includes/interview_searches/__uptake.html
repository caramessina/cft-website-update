  <h2>Rhetorical Genre Studies: Uptake</h2>
       <h3>Critical Uptake</h3>
       <ul>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
             don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
             came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
             into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
             ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that. "Okay, well, let's just do Korra next,"
             because I was pretty sure
             that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
             of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
             of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
             watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it. I was very
             much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
             and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
             style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality. And
             then, just
             seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
             once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
             not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
             the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
             there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
             Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
             super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
             of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
             relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
             should take five steps back, and let's just
             focus on these two.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
             serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
             just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
             things that made me super uncomfortable. And it's also, given the
             audience, this is considered a family show. So, I realized over time that maybe I
             don't have to write that. If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
             it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
             press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
             slaves is super ... I didn't want to
             contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
             [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
             more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
             been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
             thing.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So now,
             I sort of write when I want to, when I have the motivation. And if I'm feeling it,
             yeah, I'll do a little bit. Like somebody requested a prompt two weeks ago. I was
             like, "You know what? Why not. I'm feeling it. We're going to go for it." I learned
             to just not push it,
             don't write what other people are demanding, necessarily. And it's okay to learn from
             other writers. Like I said
             with coeurdastronaute, everything she writes is like, "I'm in
             love with this. It's great. How can I maybe write something similar to that? What
             parts can I take from this that I want to emulate?" Especially with the prompts and
             setting boundaries like you
             mentioned earlier. It's writing what you want. My audience should be myself, at the
             end of the day. I
             want to write the things that I want to read. Even if I'd much rather prefer just
             reading it and not having to put the time and effort into clacking my way through
             it, if I want to read it, I have to write it sometimes, which is fine. But I should
             enjoy the things that I'm writing. And it's okay that maybe only three other people
             also liked it, but I like it.</li>
          <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And
             then there was a bit of a lull until my delving into the Indian forums. And there
             we
             would do the meta analysis and satirical writings and so on.  Actually, I completely
             forgot, there was a period where I
             would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because I don't do that
             anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment with writing
             and being critical of source materials and so on. I guess you can say it was a nudge
             to move from passive
             consumption to active consumption.</li>
          <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it's just existing
             personally as a marginalized person. The way that that storyline was handled in LOK,
             I think I wasn't quite comfortable with it, just the very idea of the movement
             disappearing because of one man's end. It seems so unrealistic because there was a
             real situation with inequality there. Because we see that the world has adapted to
             cater for benders, and we don't quite know non-benders are faring in that world,
             what kind of opportunities they're having. And based on the conflict that the show
             raised, it was clear that non-benders were in a position where they weren't having
             ends meet or they weren't getting the jobs that they hoped to get. So both
             as a black person and as a woman, it was just important for me to recognize that
             in text and get around to exploring what that might have meant for other
             characters who weren't within the Circle of the Avatar and had powerful
             connections. The universe raises really
             interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
             we
             kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
             thing about fandom and fan
             fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that either there
             wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important enough to
             explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always in the
             forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the world," not
             just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
             through.</li>
          <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular, I think it's fascinating
             that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all these really powerful girl
             and women characters who were, for the most part, respected, at least in later
             years. Because when we first meet the Avatar world, we know
             that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all this power, she's in this
             position where she could eventually have the throne, she isn't respected by her own
             father. And I
             think I'd actually forgotten about this until someone else had written it in their
             own fan fiction, which is part of what's so fun about reading fan fiction. There are
             all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on right away, but someone else mentions
             it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the world and look at it from a different
             angle. But even Katara in the
             beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use waterbending beyond
             healing, and she goes on to become one of the greatest
             waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have this really
             powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends someone who is,
             up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more ruthless and so
             forth. So it was interesting to see all
             these female characters get to be complex and powerful and not have that held
             against them, unless you count Azula and how that ended for
             her.</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
             show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
             just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
             not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
             female-female relationships as well, because a lot of the media already does a lot
             of
             the male-female exploration. And a lot of the purpose of fandom
             is to sort of explore beyond what we're just given.</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to actually put some Game
             of Thrones content on those tags to begin with because back when I was writing it,
             there wasn't a lot really going for it. LGBT fan fics, yeah sure, but
             gender fluid and gender
             related things, it wasn't really there. While I do ship them together romantically,
             I
             wanted to write something that also reflected that you could do like a very intimate
             moment without bring sex into it as well. I feel for them, a lot of their fics also
             had a lot of like Jaime
             being the man and Brienne finally being able to let her guard
             down. It's
             something that I wanted to, again, wanted to bring into a fan fic to kind of make
             it
             more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and
             wondering the same thing. Like, where is this content that
             should be out there because it's in the books and why is no one taking this up and
             writing about it?</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
             actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
             how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
             how she had gotten to living with Jaime. I just find their relationship in
             canon to be so interesting because it was one of
             the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
             pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
             surprised. Brienne was what a lot of
             these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
             places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
             and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
             of her issues with not being able
             to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
             heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
             always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
             gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable There's a lot
             of, again, fan fic already out there of
             them being intimate, but it was all
             very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
             vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
             I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
             own instead.</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, it's depressingly small. I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
             less fan fic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
             unique friendship/relationship as like a side note, I think the show really undercut
             Jaime and Brienne's
             relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
             kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her. I was
             like, "Boy is a head shorter than her." That was part of the appeal was that Jaime
             had this big, beautiful wife that was taller than him
             and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
             wonderful?" That was part of what made it so enjoyable a lot of
             the fics, even with Jaime and Brienne is just depressingly, like, "Wow, if I
             wanted to read this fic, I'd just go to like any romance section and find
             it."</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I would almost want to just write fic out of
             spite.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I literally got up off the couch and walked away when
             she got beheaded. I was very upset. It pissed me
             off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
             slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
             did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
             white women. That was very, very frustrating and irritating to
             me. So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
             of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
             That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
             thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
             in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
             and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
             unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
             me
             try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
             There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
             improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful. The
             "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
             People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
             right there." So I had the "What if." Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
             The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
             right. Ratings may change, warnings may change, series,
             spoilers, all those kind of speak for themselves, just to let you know that okay,
             once again, this isn't static. This is something that changes story by story. Some
             of them may be Gen, some of them, I haven't written one yet, but some of them may
             be
             adult in the future. Some of them may have a lot of violence in them, so just be
             aware. Don't ever come back to this fic and think, "This is what it is." Because
             that's not it. I think my
             characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
             "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
             it may be out of character." Like I said, new fandoms are hard because they
             are. I have a lot of Game of Thrones stuff on the cutting
             room floor, before I decided what to actually post. And there is about 20 other
             drabbles for the one series that haven't made it yet, because I'm one of those
             writers. Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
             that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that Alternate universe, canon
             divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
             want to get blasted on that one. Missandei deserved
             better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
             they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
             would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23]. Fluff and angst, I
             cannot write straight fluff. I'm incapable. You have to have pain with your
             pleasure. I can't do it.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
             agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
             dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
             that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
             Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
             we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
             that was a little irritating to me. So I wanted
             her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
             supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
             that. I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
             beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
             thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Canon Compliant</h3>
       <ul>
          <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that for
             the actual research it was not so much that I did it for this particular fanfic, as
             it was more that I love that era a lot. So, I had tended to research it before, as
             well. So, I had a lot of information that I kind of knew in colloquial terms. But
             I did
             not remember the exact way that he had died, so then I kind of went searching for
             that. And then, I mean, from there it kind of spiraled into researching other things
             and kind of reading up more about Akbar and more about Jodhaa. And I'm an avid
             research. I mean, that's what I do now. And then, of course, you have the Targaryen
             colors, which are black, which are mourning colors according to the Western
             culture. And all of it kind of comes together. And, of course,
             Rajput culture is known for its red, its vibrant, blood red. And obviously, that's
             a
             Targaryen color. And all of this kind of, to me, I mean, I think that's what
             a lot of fanficiton is, at least. It's taking things that are already there and kind
             of pooling them together. And sometimes you have amazing coincidences that people
             just don't think about. And it's about exploiting those coincidences, and making
             them sound like, "Oh, I'm so brilliant. I actually had thought about it
             beforehand." Where I
             just didn't translate them into Rajput or Hindi words. Because I just use
             whatever I knew, because I speak Kannada at home. And that's
             another language entirely. And I was just running out of time, and I said, "You know
             what? No, I'll just handle it myself. And not translate it, and hope that nobody
             minds. I think a lot of the research and a lot of the material
             was just about identifying and pulling disparate ideas together that I knew.
             From either my own culture because, of course,
             this is partially my own culture. And also, the historical
             details of [inaudible 00:27:49]. And I think that was what
             was very important to me, especially in this story, was puling it all together so
             that there weren't any open endings. And the research really, somehow, it helped in
             pulling that together.</li>
          <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think if you look at A Song of Ice and Fire, technically,
             more than Game of Thrones, you
             actually get more of a cultural tension due to just the difference between the
             North and the South. And all of that. And I do think that George R. R. Martin
             has kind of perpetuated the idea, simply because he is English. So, the whole
             idea that in England, where Northerners are tougher and everything than
             Southerners. And I don't know anything more about it. But I think that's kind of
             one of the underlying and unconscious biases within the framework of the
             canon. But within this particular fic, as I said earlier, I
             really wanted to already have that tension. Especially that religious tension between
             Jon and
             Sansa. And have that difference, where both of them and neither of them are
             willing to compromise on that. And the regional tensions, I think, are already
             there in the canon. But then the cultural tensions stem almost entirely
             from the differences within their upbringing, I'm pretty sure. Within their
             families. And I mean, there are
             cultural differences within, I mean, people that I've grown up with in India,
             and people in the U.S. And even though you're living side by side, that doesn't
             necessarily mean that you have the same cultural background.
             And I think that's something that both of them don't understand. And both of them
             kind of try to understand slowly. And, I mean, we don't know if she relies more on
             her religion because she left her homeland, and came to the North. And just
             wanted some desperate way, something to rely on that's her family, or that
             reminded her of home. But to me, at least, I can imagine, especially the actual
             Jodhaa, going to Akbar's Islamic court. And basically being all alone, and not
             having very many allies. And finding some sort of a solace in her religion of
             Hinduism. And if you're talking about other moments,
             like when Sansa wants to give Jon his name, and he asks her to read it out loud. I
             think that's another moment of compromise. Because as much as she's giving him the
             gift,
             she's also giving him his name. And she's stepping across her own cultural
             boundaries to help him with that, which Jon doesn't completely
             understand.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I hate that I did it, but I did real-person
             fanfiction for Paramore. Thinking of it now, it's always like, "God, that's not
             good. I shouldn't have done it, but here we are." And from those three, you can see
             that they have
             very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
             queer
             characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
             go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
             their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
             situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
             different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
             know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
             way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
             So, I tried to mix it up on occasion. And
             okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
             notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
             figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
             she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
             Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
             things stand out immediately. Even in the modern drabbles, or the
             other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
             she can access that. And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
             gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
             age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
             she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
             life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
             all the time. I loved that. Even if, and I think
             once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
             maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
             to see
             that, but I liked that they
             weren't immediate, for the most part. They wanted to be friends first, but they were
             so good together that I wanted to be able to
             sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes. Things like that, you notice
             immediately, but also that
             it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
             I
             don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
             trying to get portrayed.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
             only get a certain amount of them in canon. So, it's kind of just how I always
             imagined her parents were just going to always be there for her. And we do see that
             in season three, where she's immediately going to bat for them and each
             other. So, at the same time,
             it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
             since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
             until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
             a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
             decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
             this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
             case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
             Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
             bit. So, I just tried to stay true to that, I guess, in some
             regard, as far as her relationship went.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, for that chapter, I want to say, like everything
             else in the collection, it was a prompt, but it was something that I didn't want to
             ham-fist it, because Korra's definitely, she's
             traumatized. We see that more than once,  So, in this one in particular, she's trying
             to have a good experience and maybe power
             through it, but then, in that brief lapse where she forgets that she's tied down
             and then she tries to sit up, it's sort of like a muscle memory thing, where
             she's back there the last time she was chained up and couldn't
             move. But also, at the same time, I wanted Asami to immediately
             be there and to be immediately helpful and not push her. She was just trying to be
             comforting. You hear stories about how people
             try and be helpful and just make situations worse, but at this
             point in their relationship, Korra and Asami knew each other super well, and even
             though this is an unusual situation for them, Asami knows how Korra reacts and knows
             who she is and what she's thinking. She's able to help her come back slowly, rather
             than try and make it a quick thing.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
             though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
             for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it. It was
             partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
             Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City, I wanted
             it to, like everything
             else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
             to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it. There's a writer, whose name
             I always mess up. I want to
             say it's coeurdastronaute. They do a lot of Clarke and Lexa
             stuff, but she sets the scene super well with like, "Here's the sky. Here's the
             roads. Here's the this," and I tried to emulate that. And I also wanted to give the
             collection itself a
             sendoff I was proud of. So, I spent a little bit more time on that than I did a lot
             of the other stuff, just let it marinate. "You know what? This is a good end, and
             hope you enjoyed," sort of thing.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
             was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
             possible love interests. Tahno was just a bully that people decide ... I don't
             understand why people like that, but people do. So, we spend four seasons developing
             Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
             lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
             out  immediately after
             the season finale aired, everyone was sort of unsure like, "This is canon, right?
             This is canon. That's what this looks
             like," "Korrasami's canon. That's
             what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
             up to that point, there really hadn't been
             a whole lot of huge representation for female ships. So, these big cartoons that are
             for kids are doing more
             for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
             kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
             much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust." So, to
             see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
             god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
             have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, so at the
             same time I was writing this fan fic, I was writing another one that kind of delved
             into the timeline of how Jaime grew up. It went
             into his relationship with his father, he was caught walking in his mother's red
             heels and he got very scolded and punished for it. I wanted
             to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
             in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
             that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
             reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
             very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
             and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit. I wanted something similar, but
             would still
             make me feel like that, but wanted to make it more intimate and feel like it was
             still just as opening, but with actions and not just with words. trying to work through
             gender things. I
             wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
             their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
             that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
             work through those emotions with me.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
             I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
             outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
             really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
             to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a very hard time
             getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
             motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
             are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
             that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
             top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges. Or if
             you're using words, and I'm like, okay, I've never heard that word used on the show,
             so now you've just dropped a bomb in the middle of a wedding cake, and there's cake
             everywhere. It just pulls me out.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Canon Resistant</h3>
       <ul>
          <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
             clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
             Jon is raised a Targaryen. And it is an angsty fic. It's not like a comedy, there
             is angst.
             And it's one of the major points of the entire fanfic. And the reason I did the Jodhaa
             Akbar tag was actually
             because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
             other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
             fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
             particular tag. I mean, this fic is obviously
             dramatized and all that. But the essential part of it is that both of them have
             this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
             that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
             see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
             very difficult way of going through life. And it's not
             necessarily a happy life that you lead when you have that kind of a
             mentality.</li>
          <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>A Jon who would grow up in a Targaryen
             court would look very different in the Targaryen [inaudible
             00:53:09] than with a Targaryen father. And the thing is, as much as he looked like
             Ned on a physical level, Ned is not the
             Ned that we see in canon. Because he's very much a person who has been basically
             warring for however Jon has been alive. Especially the quote that you put up here,
             which refers to Sansa's eyes. Because that was a moment for me, I think, more than
             anything else. Because, actually, Aishwarya Rai, who plays Jodhaa,
             does not have brown eyes. She has hazel eyes.</li>
          <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But Sansa, she
             didn't have any such love interests. I mean, obviously, I was shipping her with Jon
             and everything. But there was no actual canonical basis for that on any
             level. I
             think it's just a relief to see how... Because to me, it's almost like a moment of
             such growth, is what I felt, when I felt Sansa. Because when you're young,
             [inaudible 01:20:56]. You want the perfect marriage, and
             the perfect husband, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't mean that
             you'll necessarily get it. And to me, at least, growing up is balancing those
             childhood desires, and those childhood needs with whatever you learn as you grow up.
             And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
             child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
             sure that nobody hurt her. And I think
             there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
             liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
             everything. And, obviously, there's a ton of other problems. How [inaudible
             01:21:42] Daenerys, and Cersei, and Jaime. And a number of other characters.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I like that a lot of people, I still get comments
             occasionally that are, "I've just gone through this whole thing," and you can do
             that. Even though it's 400 chapters, it's book-length. It's like a
             normal book length. It's easily digestible, and each thing's its own thing, so if
             you want to stop it and come back to it later, you can. People do usually, if you're
             feeling a specific mood, and go find that specific one and just go through a couple
             of those. I like that it's sort of, you don't have to have a super amount of
             emotional investment in it, like super long, 10-chapter fics that are 100,000
             words. Like yes, it's very good. I enjoy it. But sometimes, I'm just in
             the mood for something light and I like that I can provide that for people who want
             that. I also like that you can sort of see a progression of
             how I wrote them and how my own skills have maybe, hopefully developed. And even
             just, it did end up being four years' worth of time so it was, when I think I started
             it, Korrasami hadn't
             been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
             And maybe, I think,
             during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
             different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
             strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
             different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
             know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
             way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
             So, I tried to mix it up on occasion. And
             okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
             notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
             figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
             she's maybe not as white as everybody else in

             other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
             she can access that. And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
             gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
             age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
             she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
             life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
             all the time. I loved that. Even if, and I think
             once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
             maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
             to see
             that, but I liked that they

             so good together that I wanted to be able to

             immediately, but also that
             it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
             I
             don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
             trying to get portrayed.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Oh,
             the easy answer is sexism,
             because everyone sees the main heroine next to a cute boy and decides, "That's
             good. I'm going to do that," without maybe necessarily putting much more thought
             into it. Obviously, there's always going to be people who say,
             "I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
             care whether or not they necessarily gel." I'm sure there's
             people ... I feel like I went back a million years ago and looked at the first
             Korrasami fics, just out of curiosity, to see when they were published, and I'm sure
             that they were like episode one, because it's just what people do, and it's great.
             Ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon. So, it was there,
             but
             it's not surprising that a lot of people who aren't looking for it don't go and see
             it. A lot of
             straight people I know will look at a lot of these relationships and say, "Oh,
             that came from nowhere."</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
             Jamie and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
             because obviously they wouldn't be having as
             much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
             considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
             day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
             from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
             versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
             wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
             identity. But there would definitely be some push
             back, but how would that change based on the setting?
             I made her a little bit more comfortable in
             her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
             shoulder for Jaime
             who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
             well.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I knew everything that was going to
             happen until about Season Four. And was perfectly happy with it, really wasn't
             paying any attention. So, right when about Season
             Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
             Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
             no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
             brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
             thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
             wrote a Game of Thrones fan fiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
             series, the first one.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
             know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Dr. Who episodes is Turn Left. And
             it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
             What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
             And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
             and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
             the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
             that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
             world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
             would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
             maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
             how I got into that.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's not done. It's not a solid 200 pages. I'm a very
             chaotic writer, so I will get a bit of dialog in my head. I will see something, and
             I will kind of write around that, and build around that, and string a bunch of
             scenes. It's 200 pages, but it's 200 pages of broken up paragraphs, bits of dialog,
             bits of scenery. So if I ever fleshed it out, it would be much longer, because I
             have a problem containing myself. But all of a suddenly, this particular set of characters
             is no longer in the
             picture. So how does that affect everything else? How does Daenerys Targaryen deal
             with a kingdom that is pretty much knighted with a war hero still on the throne? So,
             yeah.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
             think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
             little bit of character assassination. I wanted to kind of show a Sansa who was still
             herself.
             A Sansa who was willing to not listen to him, who
             understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
             manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
             only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
             run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
             ends are." That's kind of where that idea came from. She was
             supposed to kind of get lost in the trees, and they were supposed to find her. But
             I
             thought that was a little bit ignominious for her. So then I remembered, Oh,
             Nimeria's wolf pack. I was like, they haven't used that in the show at all, so why
             not? There's actually a lot more of that fic that is written
             that didn't make it in. A whole thing where you get it from Nimeria's point of view
             where you can see her. She's like, okay, just following to see what's going to
             happen. And then when Sansa decides to run, that's when she decides to attack. But
             I
             thought that was a bit superfluous, so I took all of that out.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It doesn't matter if it's to save my life. Even if you
             said that okay, "This is the only thing you can do to survive," at this point, she's
             run. She's re-discovered her strength. She's
             done something that she didn't think she could do. She got away
             for a time. So, at this point she's just like, "No, I can't do it. I won't do it."
             That was kind of that whole, what that
             episode was about was Sansa really re-discovering herself, and what she could
             do.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Implicit/Explicit</h3>
       <ul>
          <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
             I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
             make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
             heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
             fandoms. And I think that's probably because we don't have one
             main character and one side character that's like the sidekick to the main
             character, both of them being male. You don't have that here.</li>
          <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because
             I know that a lot of people had mentioned that it was at the beginning of Season
             Six. Like, when a couple of trailers came out regarding Sansa meeting up with
             somebody in the North. It was kind of staging with Ramsay Bolton. That Jon Snow and
             Sansa Stark fandom kind of really took off. And it was the beginning of Season Six
             that it really, properly emerged. So, it would be interesting to see if there is a
             cookie cutter point that you can identify like, this is where the general public
             kind of suddenly said, "Oh, this is the moment."</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
             only get a certain amount of them in canon. So, it's kind of just how I always
             imagined her parents were just going to always be there for her. And we do see that
             in season three, where she's immediately going to bat for them and each
             other. So, at the same time,
             it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
             since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
             until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
             a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
             decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
             this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
             case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
             Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
             bit. So, I just tried to stay true to that, I guess, in some
             regard, as far as her relationship went.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>At the end of season three, we saw that development and
             we saw, especially during Korra's fight with Zaheer, Asami looked the most scared
             out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her
             recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, "That's a little gayer than it maybe
             should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
             of people took that and decided to go with it, especially since
             the relationship was [inaudible 01:00:21], whether or not ...
             Again, and at that time, we didn't know the writer's intention, so it was just
             everybody, or at least Korrasami fans, picking
             up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
             so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
             happen."</li>
          <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I was on Twitter casually
             scrolling through something, and someone from back home happened to mention how the
             finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background and
             the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
             that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
             Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
             I
             could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
             been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
             how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way. But also the
             fics I had read after the show had finished
             seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ... Obviously, it was a
             really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had happened in the gap
             years that they hadn't shown us for Korra. I kind of wanted to see
             that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular, and this was surprising
             for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I never really remember to
             think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like there was this big gap
             available to us for exploration.  So I kind
             of wanted to explore that and see how Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for
             me I like to see how the characters are responding to what's happening to them
             rather than having the plot happen to them, and with Asami there was just so much
             room to do that.</li>
          <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
             came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
             that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened. Whereas, for Asami,
             Asami
             didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have anyone. So she
             went back to someone, I guess who is an ... I
             wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic for them. But in the way
             that the relationship shifts from love and care to an act of violence
             ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore that. It's just
             fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow still find a way
             to
             circle back around to the people who have hurt them.</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I wrote it in
             one sitting in a Starbucks near my university. It was around the
             time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary and
             I tried to sort of work things out with Jaime as the main focal character You never
             really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
             to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
             with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
             wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I got a very
             interesting response from someone. I believe, maybe a week or two after. They were
             like, "It's a really well written fan fic, it's great, but why in God's (capital G)
             name, did you make Jaime like this?" And the moment I saw capital G, I was like I
             see. I tried to be as cordial as I could and I explained what I said earlier about
             my inspiration from the source material where I wanted to kind of
             explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
             because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
             as well. Yeah, that was the one big kick
             back I got from someone. I was a little bit shocked that I got the capital G person,
             but what can you do?</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
             actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
             how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
             how she had gotten to living with Jaime. I just find their relationship in
             canon to be so interesting because it was one of
             the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
             pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
             surprised. Brienne was what a lot of
             these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
             places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
             and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
             of her issues with not being able
             to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
             heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
             always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
             gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable There's a lot
             of, again, fan fic already out there of
             them being intimate, but it was all
             very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
             vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
             I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
             own instead.</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
             he always had a very strange affinity, but
             like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
             loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
             of view. I think he definitely
             is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
             means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
             it.</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
             way and being very new, if you're very new into
             like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
             a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
             higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
             or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
             You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
             anything. That's definitely
             something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
             of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
             would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
             more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
             me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
             anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
             all of that.</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>And then it just kind of gets more
             depressing as it goes on. For some reason, John and Sansa's the most popular ship.
             It's like, I understand that they're not technically related, but I don't get it
             because in the book, they had this very tense relationship and in the show I know
             that they were more around each other. Peytr/Sansa, I want to have some words with
             people. I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
             them, but I
             don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
             just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
             literally right here.
             Renly/Lauris,
             obviously. Sandor and Sansa, I will say that I like their ship name
             as San-San. I do understand the whole
             like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
             romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
             just write a Nora Roberts novel." I'd so read her books if I
             wanted to. I don't need to read them here. Most Game of Thrones fan fic is incredibly
             hetero
             normative and it's a lot of university AU, high school AU and
             I'm like, "What about literally anything else?" I did a modern universe
             [inaudible 00:37:49] Please, literally anything
             else.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was my take on the scene where Brienne and Pod meet her in the tavern, where
             she seems to be at first a little surprised, a little relieved, and then you kind
             of
             see her shut down a bit. But in my mind, I
             didn't think she didn't want it because she didn't necessarily trust Brienne, it was
             more because Peter would never let her go. Even if this person said, "I'm going to
             help you," he would never allow that, because he
             wants control of her, and that is something that she realizes, because she's not
             an idiot. She's seen this man in King's Landing, she sees how
             he operates. She sees how he operates in the Eyrie. If he doesn't have total control
             of her, he's not going to allow it. And the best way to do that would be to get rid
             of these two people. And she doesn't want anyone to die for her. So that was kind
             of
             my read on that situation.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So yeah, she's such an interesting character. There's
             so much about her that could be written that isn't written. I just kind of wanted
             to
             investigate a little bit. What would life have been like for this character?</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Fan Practices Uptake</h3>
       <ul>
          <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I've also recently published work in Fleabag, which
             was one of the fandoms that I had to write for for my Yuletide assignment. There's
             a couple of things that you see that are kind of
             interesting, and then you kind of identify a certain actor, or a certain character
             that you kind of find interesting. And then jump from there to another.</li>
          <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
             the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
             Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
             film." So, the
             person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
             universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending. So then I realized
             that Jodhaa Akbar, which is
             definitely a Desi film, had a wonderful set of characters that was definitely
             angsty, but had a wonderfully happy ending. And allowed me to write about something
             that was kind of dear to my heart as well. Because it was a Desi film. It was one
             representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
             those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
             to bridge them. Because you have to. Because it's not just
             about love, or it's not just about anything. It's about your pride, it's about your
             family's livelihood. All of those kind of come together, you have to do it. You
             don't want to, but, somehow, you have to. I think it's that gritting of your teeth,
             and getting on with life that kind of really draws me in.</li>
          <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it was football RPF
             (real person fic) fanfiction. Which was very interesting, because I think it was
             just after the 2018 World Cup. And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that
             used second person point of
             view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
             you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
             of
             view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
             what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
             more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person. And that also came
             across to a lot of readers, is what
             they were telling me, at least. Because they felt like there was a lot more gravitas
             to the entire fic that you wouldn't see in a lot of my other
             fanfics.</li>
          <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
             clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
             Jon is raised a Targaryen. And it is an angsty fic. It's not like a comedy, there
             is angst.
             And it's one of the major points of the entire fanfic. And the reason I did the Jodhaa
             Akbar tag was actually
             because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
             other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
             fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
             particular tag. I mean, this fic is obviously
             dramatized and all that. But the essential part of it is that both of them have
             this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
             that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
             see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
             very difficult way of going through life. And it's not
             necessarily a happy life that you lead when you have that kind of a
             mentality.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
             was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
             think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
             prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
             I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
             I can sort of tailor it to that," There's been
             a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
             always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
             at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
             art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
             it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
             person's mind."</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I'm
             very much a person who believes in, if you can't say it in like two words
             then you probably shouldn't. So, I like to have it, what
             is this thing? And that's it. I like to be able to say, "This is what it's going to
             be," and it doesn't necessarily need to be more complicated than that. I know a lot
             of people like to have full sentences, and
             get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
             distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
             be
             able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
             somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
             something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
             looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
             and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
             is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
             only get a certain amount of them in canon. So, it's kind of just how I always
             imagined her parents were just going to always be there for her. And we do see that
             in season three, where she's immediately going to bat for them and each
             other. So, at the same time,
             it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
             since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
             until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
             a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
             decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
             this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
             case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
             Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
             bit. So, I just tried to stay true to that, I guess, in some
             regard, as far as her relationship went.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
             though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
             for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it. It was
             partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
             Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City, I wanted
             it to, like everything
             else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
             to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it. There's a writer, whose name
             I always mess up. I want to
             say it's coeurdastronaute. They do a lot of Clarke and Lexa
             stuff, but she sets the scene super well with like, "Here's the sky. Here's the
             roads. Here's the this," and I tried to emulate that. And I also wanted to give the
             collection itself a
             sendoff I was proud of. So, I spent a little bit more time on that than I did a lot
             of the other stuff, just let it marinate. "You know what? This is a good end, and
             hope you enjoyed," sort of thing.</li>
          <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So now,
             I sort of write when I want to, when I have the motivation. And if I'm feeling it,
             yeah, I'll do a little bit. Like somebody requested a prompt two weeks ago. I was
             like, "You know what? Why not. I'm feeling it. We're going to go for it." I learned
             to just not push it,
             don't write what other people are demanding, necessarily. And it's okay to learn from
             other writers. Like I said
             with coeurdastronaute, everything she writes is like, "I'm in
             love with this. It's great. How can I maybe write something similar to that? What
             parts can I take from this that I want to emulate?" Especially with the prompts and
             setting boundaries like you
             mentioned earlier. It's writing what you want. My audience should be myself, at the
             end of the day. I
             want to write the things that I want to read. Even if I'd much rather prefer just
             reading it and not having to put the time and effort into clacking my way through
             it, if I want to read it, I have to write it sometimes, which is fine. But I should
             enjoy the things that I'm writing. And it's okay that maybe only three other people
             also liked it, but I like it.</li>
          <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
             watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
             because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
             and so on. So I got into forums and fans would translate for
             those of us who didn't speak Hindi. And obviously people would
             answer questions if you asked because you couldn't get everything in the
             translations or the summaries. And during that time, we would talk about the plot
             of
             the show, what the characters were doing, where we were expecting things to go at
             that time. It was just a lot of the basic things at fandom.</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, definitely when it comes to trying to write it
             realistically as well, but the banter back and forth was very difficult. I read a
             lot of fan fic where it can be very stalkish and when I think about it and I think
             about someone saying it out loud, I just like cringe. My face caves in. writing it
             also based off
             of my own experiences, just exploring the LGBT
             community in my area, I was kind of writing it from that
             perspective, but also not having as much information as I would like.  That, and also
             trying to write
             and finish an entire fan fic in one sitting is very difficult when it's in a public
             setting. Luckily, it happened and it was a nice exercise as well, just also to be
             able to sit and write and have it really done in one sitting and then put it out
             there was very satisfying.</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think I would want to go
             more into maybe tagging some of the triggers maybe now a days because back then
             there wasn't as much of a discussion around it. Now a days, you have more of a
             discussion around what bigger tags to put in to help people avoid it for instance.
             Now that AO3 has updated its tagging system to include and exclude.</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>And then it just kind of gets more
             depressing as it goes on. For some reason, John and Sansa's the most popular ship.
             It's like, I understand that they're not technically related, but I don't get it
             because in the book, they had this very tense relationship and in the show I know
             that they were more around each other. Peytr/Sansa, I want to have some words with
             people. I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
             them, but I
             don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
             just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
             literally right here.
             Renly/Lauris,
             obviously. Sandor and Sansa, I will say that I like their ship name
             as San-San. I do understand the whole
             like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
             romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
             just write a Nora Roberts novel." I'd so read her books if I
             wanted to. I don't need to read them here. Most Game of Thrones fan fic is incredibly
             hetero
             normative and it's a lot of university AU, high school AU and
             I'm like, "What about literally anything else?" I did a modern universe
             [inaudible 00:37:49] Please, literally anything
             else.</li>
          <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That would have been a good way to end it, not, we're going to hug
             each other and we're going to let some rocks fall. I had some really bad, some
             really heated discussions with a friend on my dashboard on Twitter. We just did that,
             like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
             and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
             interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
             dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
             front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
             interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
             not try and put this away. Yeah, it was a whole mess. People
             came out in droves, angry for different reasons.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then that's when I kind of got feedback, because the
             first fan fic, I never got any feedback from anyone. I was just like, "Oh, I'm
             shouting into the dark." So yeah, it kind of changed, and it got me a bit more
             active, and like, people actually want to say something about it. What did you think
             about it? I started getting a bit more communication, a bit more activity. And then
             people would be like, "Oh, your fan fic is
             this like this one, so why don't you go read this fan fic?" It kind of was a jumping
             off point for me.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yes. She's a weird character. Mostly she seems to almost
             be absent from things. She's window dressing. She's there, she doesn't speak, or she
             speaks, it's one or two sentences in the entire fic. And it's frustrating because
             once again in the book, she's such a pivotal character. And so, you get those fics
             where she
             either has none of those, she's either not there, or she has really none of those
             attributes. She's kind of just a yes person. Yes, Khaleesi, no Khaleesi, yes my
             queen. That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
             delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
             Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
             away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
             one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
             fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
             of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
             if I was a former slave. The one thing I
             would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
             in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
             into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
             anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
             like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fan fiction. She's really an
             underused character.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
             thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
             in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
             and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
             unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
             me
             try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
             There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
             improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful. The
             "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
             People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
             right there." So I had the "What if." Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
             The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
             right. Ratings may change, warnings may change, series,
             spoilers, all those kind of speak for themselves, just to let you know that okay,
             once again, this isn't static. This is something that changes story by story. Some
             of them may be Gen, some of them, I haven't written one yet, but some of them may
             be
             adult in the future. Some of them may have a lot of violence in them, so just be
             aware. Don't ever come back to this fic and think, "This is what it is." Because
             that's not it. I think my
             characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
             "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
             it may be out of character." Like I said, new fandoms are hard because they
             are. I have a lot of Game of Thrones stuff on the cutting
             room floor, before I decided what to actually post. And there is about 20 other
             drabbles for the one series that haven't made it yet, because I'm one of those
             writers. Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
             that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that Alternate universe, canon
             divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
             want to get blasted on that one. Missandei deserved
             better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
             they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
             would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23]. Fluff and angst, I
             cannot write straight fluff. I'm incapable. You have to have pain with your
             pleasure. I can't do it.</li>
          <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
             active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
             especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
             and
             putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>
       </ul>
