   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>People are like, "Oh..." When people talk about RWBY, the way they talk about the
         White Fang is the way they talk about radical politics. And I don't know if they realize
         it, but I always get really annoyed, because this is like bad political theory. It's
         very normal American political theory, but it's also bad. It's very much like, "Oh,
         there's no justification for violence," it's like, "I don't agree."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
         I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
         convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
         arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then I wrote a piece called [inaudible 00:05:42], which was sort of like a revisiting
         of what does... I guess it was actually about immigration, it's just I never really
         ever got around to doing a piece about immigration system, but somebody had a bad
         take about immigration in America in a piece of fanfic and I was like, "God, that's
         a really bad understanding of that friend. That is utopian and wrong."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
         very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
         you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
         original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
         through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
         and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
         with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
         get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
         you.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was coming into my own politically, I was becoming my own political individual in
         a way I hadn't been before. Like I had politics, but this is around the time that
         I'm really radicalized, and just me engaging with those contexts.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
         there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
         feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
         a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
         different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
         in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
         and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
         looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I was under the impression, reading or engaging with this text, I came away with
         this feeling like the Northern Water Tribe is somewhat... very different from the
         rest of the world, and there are ways that it plays as... I don't know if it was textual
         or sort of fan-driven more, but I remember coming away with this feeling that there
         is a marginalized subjectivity in the Northern Water Tribe. And so telling this story
         about difference in culture, and we'll get to... I'll get to Korra's upbringing a
         little bit later, because you're going to ask about 10 minutes later about Korra's
         upbringing. But I want to... Basically that I think Korra's upbringing is particularly
         reflective of that culture, yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I come away from Korra feeling like, "This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy
         that there's not homophobia in a world with gender in the like weird way that... In
         ways that still reflect our I think gender and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the
         way that we have a sense of gender. Big, capital G Gender. And so I thought like,
         "What does it mean to have culture in the context of... What does it mean to be a
         cosmopolitan city where... There's both a degree of marginalization for like the Northern
         Water Tribe closing... Not so much that rules that are really intended to enforce
         gender norms are going to be there. And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a
         different understanding of gender in context," yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Asami probably can't like cook...because I think it's either canonical or in fanon,
         and I kind of like that, because I like the notion that... I like the notion that
         someone who's very good at some things, but just not good at other things.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that this is a piece that comes from a weird part of what I understood about
         that world. To me, Korra grows up in a compound with people who are older than her,
         who aren't likely to tell her the truth about things. Because the White Lotus is an
         organization of people who are fundamentally keeping her apart. And I remember being
         like, "Oh, these folks are not going to tell a child about queer sexuality." Particularly
         sexuality is a hard topic, you grow up in that kind of compound in a world where queer
         identities are looked down on, you're going to come away with this very strange view
         about that. And you might just be told nothing.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
         her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
         Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
         is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
         dress herself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
         progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
         man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
         and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
         said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
         understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
         woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
         This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
         institution itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>In the context of this piece, a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois
         radical is that I'm not going to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really
         have a sense of class politics at the time, or have the beginnings of that study.
         That's only beginning to be born</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So to me, Hiroshi's both a man that would destroy his children for the things he believes,
         and in some sense for his own power. But also a man who genuinely is providing aid
         and comfort and resources for fighting for what he views as liberation, and that liberation's
         probably genuine at some level. I think it's fair to say that there is a political
         bender-like supremacy at the beginning. I mean there is, we know there's a bender
         supremacy at the beginning of The Legend of Korra. And so that's how I understand
         Hiroshi.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to give a sense of what is the politics of the Northern Water Tribe? And
         I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water Tribe,
         or is not criminalized anymore. Also I wanted to say this is a different relationship.
         But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give
         up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I know what our reactionary politics is like, I think I'd start around the
         time that Kuvira is beginning to gain power. I'd write it as a story that talks about
         immigration, and talks about sweeping panic and fear that spill off of that. I'd probably
         talk about gender through those lenses, and I'd probably talk about humanity in a
         slightly more complex... I'd probably make it a story that... I'd probably both use
         modern messages to say that, I'd probably talk more about police state, and police
         state as endless spying networks where you don't know when you're being spied on and
         when you're not, and endless police states</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
         a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
         but it's good.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also I think it's when fiction ends, it does draw people who are like, "Oh, I want
         to write more on this subject, I want to play with these concepts again." There's
         also a distinct un-ended-ness</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad.
         But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want
         to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want
         to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that!
         I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.[inaudible 00:47:08]
         what are other ways we can imagine it?</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And that creates fanon, which means you get this whole long space of people being
         like, "Oh yeah, I am writing about this content of fanon in this alternate universe,
         I'm going to write a piece about a radio show</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of [inaudible 00:47:39], some
         of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion that comes out of that. So
         I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and I think that it's liberating
         for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also, if you're looking at a subtext, my people they were like, "Oh yeah, I want to
         tell this story, I want to finish this story." And there's a degree to which it a
         queer reading, there's this political tendency to look at fiction and say, "I am going
         to tell the story you didn't." And so during the subtext period, you've already got
         these people who are basically being like, "Yo, I'm going to tell this story.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
         love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
         stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
         of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
         of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
         "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
         who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
         of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I don't know, I don't know if I'd use the fluff and angst tags anymore, just because
         I don't talk about my literature in those terms as much anymore, as I used to, but...
         Largely because nobody...You don't use those tags as much anymore in my view, like
         we don't talk about... Those are very much Fanfiction.net-y terms that pulled over,
         I don't see them as I used to.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon
         compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant,"
         as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant
         sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense
         to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a
         story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine
         that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on
         what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now.
         That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories
         that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I imagine that it's because... It makes sense to tell a friendship story with characters
         who are already very close friends, and characters who are becoming close friends.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I mean, canon queer relationship is more common because there is canon queer relationship.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> a [inaudible 00:57:08] of the audience that come later are less interested in acknowledging
         or talking about race. Given this is a proportion, I don't know if [inaudible 00:57:24]
         but more people as a fandom and those few people aren't interested in talking about
         race in ways that people who had been there before were, and those people who were
         there before continued to talk about race, or if there is an effectively gentrifying
         mmoment that a white fandom comes in, pushes out a fandom of color. I don't know how
         this tag is used, so I would feel hesitant to say something definite. But I find that
         a little bit troublesome.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>because it looks to me here that what you're seeing is a movement from seeing the
         word girlfriend in a context of a text that's about a set of texts about relationships
         in a more heterosexual perspective, in a story about women. Because it looks to me
         that this is a story that, if you see jealous there, that looks like I'm looking at
         a piece that's from Korra's point of view. But then if I'm looking at boyfriend, I'm
         also thinking about Korra and Mako.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>The context is basically just, yeah, things you would expect people would say on a
         date, things you'd expect people to do on a date, things that writers do when they
         run out of words, like chuckle.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also this more mature understanding of a relationship, seeing their partner as a dork
         versus like, seeing them as cute. And obviously you see your partner is cute for a
         long time after you start dating, that... Viewing someone as a dork is a more developed
         sense of what a relationship is.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I've also recently published work in Fleabag, which
         was one of the fandoms that I had to write for for my Yuletide assignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
         the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
         Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
         film."</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
         person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
         universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
         view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
         you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
         of
         view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
         what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
         more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, of course, you have the Targaryen
         colors, which are black, which are mourning colors according to the Western
         culture. And all of it kind of comes together. And, of course,
         Rajput culture is known for its red, its vibrant, blood red. And obviously, that's
         a
         Targaryen color.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
         clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
         Jon is raised a Targaryen.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
         because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
         other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
         fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
         particular tag.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But within this particular fic, as I said earlier, I
         really wanted to already have that tension. Especially that religious tension between
         Jon and
         Sansa. And have that difference, where both of them and neither of them are
         willing to compromise on that.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the regional tensions, I think, are already
         there in the canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, I mean, we don't know if she relies more on
         her religion because she left her homeland, and came to the North. And just
         wanted some desperate way, something to rely on that's her family, or that
         reminded her of home. But to me, at least, I can imagine, especially the actual
         Jodhaa, going to Akbar's Islamic court. And basically being all alone, and not
         having very many allies. And finding some sort of a solace in her religion of
         Hinduism.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>A Jon who would grow up in a Targaryen
         court would look very different in the Targaryen [inaudible
         00:53:09] than with a Targaryen father.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the thing is, as much as he looked like Ned on a physical level, Ned is not the
         Ned that we see in canon. Because he's very much a person who has been basically
         warring for however Jon has been alive.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, actually, Aishwarya Rai, who plays Jodhaa,
         does not have brown eyes. She has hazel eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
         I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
         make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
         heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
         fandoms. And I think that's probably because we don't have one
         main character and one side character that's like the sidekick to the main
         character, both of them being male. You don't have that here.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because
         I know that a lot of people had mentioned that it was at the beginning of Season
         Six. Like, when a couple of trailers came out regarding Sansa meeting up with
         somebody in the North. It was kind of staging with Ramsay Bolton. That Jon Snow and
         Sansa Stark fandom kind of really took off. And it was the beginning of Season Six
         that it really, properly emerged. So, it would be interesting to see if there is a
         cookie cutter point that you can identify like, this is where the general public
         kind of suddenly said, "Oh, this is the moment."</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But Sansa, she
         didn't have any such love interests. I mean, obviously, I was shipping her with Jon
         and everything. But there was no actual canonical basis for that on any
         level.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
         very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
         queer
         characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
         go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
         their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
         situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
         a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
         always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
         at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
         art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
         it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
         person's mind."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
         been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
         And maybe, I think,
         during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
         different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
         strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
         get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
         distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
         be
         able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
         somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
         something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
         looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
         and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
         is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
         seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
         once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
         not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
         the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
         there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
         </li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
         super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
         of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
         relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
         should take five steps back, and let's just
         focus on these two.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And
         okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
         notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
         figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
         she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
         Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
         things stand out immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even in the modern drabbles, or the
         other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
         she can access that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
         gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
         age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
         she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
         life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
         all the time.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>They wanted to be friends first, but they were so good together that I wanted to be
         able to
         sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
         only get a certain amount of them in canon.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, it's kind of just how I always
         imagined her parents were just going to always be there for her. And we do see that
         in season three, where she's immediately going to bat for them and each
         other.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
         it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
         since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
         until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
         a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
         decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
         this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
         case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
         Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
         bit.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I just tried to stay true to that, I guess, in some
         regard, as far as her relationship went.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, for that chapter, I want to say, like everything
         else in the collection, it was a prompt, but it was something that I didn't want to
         ham-fist it, because Korra's definitely, she's
         traumatized. We see that more than once,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
         it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
         press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
         slaves is super ... I didn't want to
         contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
         [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
         more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
         been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
         thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
         though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
         for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>It was
         partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
         Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a writer, whose name I always mess up. I want to
         say it's coeurdastronaute. They do a lot of Clarke and Lexa
         stuff, but she sets the scene super well with like, "Here's the sky. Here's the
         roads. Here's the this," and I tried to emulate that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's okay to learn from other writers. Like I said
         with coeurdastronaute, everything she writes is like, "I'm in
         love with this. It's great. How can I maybe write something similar to that? What
         parts can I take from this that I want to emulate?"</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Especially with the prompts and setting boundaries like you
         mentioned earlier. It's writing what you want.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Obviously, there's always going to be people who say,
         "I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
         care whether or not they necessarily gel." I'm sure there's
         people ... I feel like I went back a million years ago and looked at the first
         Korrasami fics, just out of curiosity, to see when they were published, and I'm sure
         that they were like episode one, because it's just what people do, and it's great.
         Ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>At the end of season three, we saw that development and
         we saw, especially during Korra's fight with Zaheer, Asami looked the most scared
         out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her
         recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, "That's a little gayer than it maybe
         should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
         of people took that and decided to go with it, especially since
         the relationship was [inaudible 01:00:21], whether or not ...
         Again, and at that time, we didn't know the writer's intention, so it was just
         everybody, or at least Korrasami fans, picking
         up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
         so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
         happen."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
         was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
         possible love interests.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Korrasami's canon. That's
         what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
         up to that point, there really hadn't been
         a whole lot of huge representation for female ships.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
         see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
         god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
         have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I got into forums and fans would
         translate for those of us who didn't speak Hindi. And obviously
         people would answer questions if you asked because you couldn't get everything in
         the translations or the summaries. And during that time, we would talk about the
         plot of the show, what the characters were doing, where we were expecting things to
         go at that time. It was just a lot of the basic things at fandom.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>To
         realizing that there was a community of people who were also interested in
         discussing how these shows and books and games et cetera were failing us, whether
         it
         was in terms of the content or the representation or just releasing new things like
         thought arcs that weren't followed through on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I completely forgot, there was a
         period where I would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because
         I
         don't do that anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment
         with writing and being critical of source materials and so on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess you can say it was a
         nudge to move from passive consumption to active consumption.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But also the fics I had read after the
         show had finished seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ...
         Obviously, it was a really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had
         happened in the gap years that they hadn't shown us for Korra.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I kind of wanted to see that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular,
         and this was surprising for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I
         never really remember to think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like
         there was this big gap available to us for exploration.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So I kind of wanted to explore that and see how
         Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for me I like to see how the characters
         are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to
         them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Partly, I wasn't quite sure what tags to use
         because I was still learning.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And also on being canon-compliant,
         but still ... I was working in an area where there was nothing for canon yet. I'm
         assuming that with the comics now, we'll get more information on that regard. But
         at
         the time, there was nothing in that area. So I wanted it to be known that it was
         still within canon's bounds, but there were going to be things being explored that
         weren't articulated in canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
         And in terms of relationships and love and so forth, it was I guess just coming back
         to what I like to explore in fiction, which is how people are interacting with each
         other, what it means for them. And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
         not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
         audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
         exploration. So I like to see for myself how their worth is existing within these
         relationships, what it means for them and what it can mean for the audience and so
         forth.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Whereas, for
         Asami, Asami didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have
         anyone. So she went back to someone, I
         guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
         for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
         act of violence ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore
         that. It's just fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow
         still find a way to circle back around to the people who have hurt
         them.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
         interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
         we
         kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
         thing about fandom
         and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
         either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
         enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
         in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
         world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
         through.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I think I'd actually forgotten about this until
         someone else had written it in their own fanfiction, which is part of what's so fun
         about reading fanfiction. There are all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on
         right away, but someone else mentions it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the
         world and look at it from a different angle.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
         show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
         just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
         not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
         female-female relationships as well, because a lot of the media already does a lot
         of
         the male-female exploration. And a lot of the purpose of fandom
         is to sort of explore beyond what we're just given.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>You never
         really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
         to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
         with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
         wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
         Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
         because obviously they wouldn't be having as
         much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
         considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
         day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
         from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
         versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
         wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
         identity. But there would definitely be some push
         back, but how would that change based on the setting?
         I made her a little bit more comfortable in
         her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
         shoulder for Jaime
         who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
         well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, definitely when it comes to trying to write it
         realistically as well, but the banter back and forth was very difficult. I read a
         lot of fanfic where it can be very stalkish and when I think about it and I think
         about someone saying it out loud, I just like cringe. My face caves in.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>from the source material where I wanted to kind of
         explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
         because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
         as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to actually put some Game
         of Thrones content on those tags to begin with because back when I was writing it,
         there wasn't a lot really going for it. LGBT fanfics, yeah sure, but
         gender fluid and gender
         related things, it wasn't really there.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Like, where is this content that
         should be out there because it's in the books and why is no one taking this up and
         writing about it?</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think I would want to go
         more into maybe tagging some of the triggers maybe now a days because back then
         there wasn't as much of a discussion around it. Now a days, you have more of a
         discussion around what bigger tags to put in to help people avoid it for instance.
         Now that AO3 has updated its tagging system to include and exclude.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I just find their relationship in
         canon to be so interesting because it was one of
         the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
         pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
         surprised.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
         them being intimate, but it was all
         very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
         vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
         I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
         own instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
         he always had a very strange affinity, but
         like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
         loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
         of view.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think he definitely
         is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
         means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That's definitely
         something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
         of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
         would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
         more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
         me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
         anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
         all of that.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted
         to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
         in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
         that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
         reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
         very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
         and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted something similar, but would still
         make me feel like that, but wanted to make it more intimate and feel like it was
         still just as opening, but with actions and not just with words.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
         them, but I
         don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
         just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
         literally right here.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Sandor and Sansa, I will say that I like their ship name
         as San-San. I do understand the whole
         like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
         romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
         just write a Nora Roberts novel." I'd so read her books if I
         wanted to. I don't need to read them here.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, it's depressingly small. I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
         less fanfic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
         unique friendship/relationship</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I would almost want to just write fic out of
         spite.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I had some really bad, some
         really heated discussions with a friend on my dashboard on Twitter. We just did that,
         like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
         and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
         interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
         dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
         front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
         interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
         not try and put this away. Yeah, it was a whole mess. People
         came out in droves, angry for different reasons.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then people would be like, "Oh, your fanfic is
         this like this one, so why don't you go read this fanfic?" It kind of was a jumping
         off point for me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
         Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
         Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
         no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
         brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
         thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
         wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
         series, the first one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
         know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
         And
         it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
         What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
         And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
         and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
         the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
         that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
         world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
         would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
         maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
         how I got into that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
         written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
         okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
         alone.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But all of a suddenly, this particular set of characters is no longer in the
         picture. So how does that affect everything else? How does Daenerys Targaryen deal
         with a kingdom that is pretty much united with a war hero still on the throne?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
         I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
         outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
         really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
         to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a very hard time
         getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
         motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
         are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
         that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
         top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because one thing as a writer that will pull me completely out of a story is if
         there is a colloquialism that should not belong. Or if
         you're using words, and I'm like, okay, I've never heard that word used on the show,
         so now you've just dropped a bomb in the middle of a wedding cake, and there's cake
         everywhere. It just pulls me out.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
         think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
         little bit of character assassination.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted to kind of show a Sansa who was still herself.
         A Sansa who was willing to not listen to him, who
         understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
         manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
         only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
         run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
         ends are." That's kind of where that idea came from.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She was
         supposed to kind of get lost in the trees, and they were supposed to find her. But
         I
         thought that was a little bit ignominious for her. So then I remembered, Oh,
         Nimeria's wolf pack. I was like, they haven't used that in the show at all, so why
         not?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
         of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
         That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
         delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
         Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
         away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
         one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
         fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
         of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
         if I was a former slave. The one thing I
         would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
         in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
         into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
         anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
         like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
         underused character.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
         thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
         in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
         and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
         unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
         me
         try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
         There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
         improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
         "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
         People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
         right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
         The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
         right.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
         never know. I think my
         characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
         "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
         it may be out of character."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
         divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
         want to get blasted on that one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
         better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
         they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
         would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23].</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
         dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
         that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
         Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
         beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
         thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And like she says in the fic even
         if I get bit by a lizard-lion or I starve, that's my choice. But it won't be going
         back
         to a ruined Winterfell to marry a legitimized bastard.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was my take on the scene where Brienne and Pod meet her in the tavern, where
         she seems to be at first a little surprised, a little relieved, and then you kind
         of
         see her shut down a bit.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But in my mind, I
         didn't think she didn't want it because she didn't necessarily trust Brienne, it was
         more because Peter would never let her go. Even if this person said, "I'm going to
         help you," he would never allow that, because he
         wants control of her, and that is something that she realizes, because she's not
         an idiot. She's seen this man in King's Landing, she sees how
         he operates. She sees how he operates in the Eyrie. If he doesn't have total control
         of her, he's not going to allow it. And the best way to do that would be to get rid
         of these two people. And she doesn't want anyone to die for her. So that was kind
         of
         my read on that situation.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It doesn't matter if it's to save my life. Even if you
         said that okay, "This is the only thing you can do to survive," at this point, she's
         run. She's re-discovered her strength. She's
         done something that she didn't think she could do. She got away
         for a time. So, at this point she's just like, "No, I can't do it. I won't do it."
         That was kind of that whole, what that
         episode was about was Sansa really re-discovering herself, and what she could
         do.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So yeah, [Missandei]'s such an interesting character. There's
         so much about her that could be written that isn't written. I just kind of wanted
         to
         investigate a little bit. What would life have been like for this character?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
         Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
         without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
         something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
         times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
         I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
         to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
         think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
         sentiment.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
         seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
         woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
         anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
         back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
         Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
         slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
         she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
         jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
         great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
         I've seen it before.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's a smile of, I
         can't think of the word, but being resigned to my fate. And if this is it, then this
         is it. And like I say, she recognizes in Cersei the same evil that she saw in
         Astapor where she's kind of like, "No, you
         would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
         think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
         better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
         are not. You are exactly like them." And in the end, she kind
         of wants to let her know. It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
         that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me. I see exactly what
         you are.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Like I
         said, as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
         be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
         be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself. Kind of like, I hate to use the
         comparison, but if you ever get out of a really bad relationship, and you're just
         like, "No, never again. I know the signs. I will never let that happen to me again."
         And for her of course it's more extreme,
         from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
         decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
         getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
         found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
         myself.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
         the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
         so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
         Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
         and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But I can
         see, especially in Season Five, and Six, and Seven, where you see Jon Snow, Sansa
         Stark, because these two characters kind of get back together in the show. When
         they're together, you can see their dynamic in everything else. And they look good
         together. That's always a good thing. It's always big when it comes to shipping, who
         looks good with who.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
         active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
         especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
         and
         putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>

<h2>Uptake: Critical Uptake</h2>
  <div class="interview-search-analysis">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors discuss critical uptakes. Uptakes are the ways in which a writer responds to one genre by engaging in another genre, following particular conventions or expectations for how to engage with the second genre. A critical uptake occurs “when writers...resist harmful and exclusive cultural ideologies in their uptake” (<a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/jwa/vol3/messina.pdf">Messina, 2019</a>). These ideologies may be embedded in the canonical show or even fan genre conventions.
</p>
<p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 39</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Each of the authors reflects on critically uptaking a genre, each citing motivations along with their choices in their fanfics. For Kittya Cullen, Aria, Gillywulf, and Writegirl, they challenge how particular characters or groups of people are represented in either the original text or fanfic genre conventions. To write fanfic is not only to engage with the texts, characters, and universes, but to recognize genre conventions from the original texts and either mirror or challenge them.</p>
<p>Fantasy television shows or movies, like GOT, often replicate misogynistic and/or racist conventions in the texts. In GOT, Writegirl argues the writers removed both Sansa’s and Missandei’s agency. Writegirl’s fic is a critical uptake of fantasy genre conventions in which women characters — particularly women characters of color — are subjected to constant violence. Writegirl explicitly states that she “wanted [Sansa] to have a little bit more agency” and she wanted to give Missandei “some of her dignity back.” Kittya Cullen, too, explains that her early writing was satirical as a way to critique the original texts. The satire genre often mimics generic conventions with an intent to both humor an audience as well as address specific political ideologies. Satire, when produced with a critical eye, is almost always a critical uptake because of its familiarity and resistance to particular generic conventions.</p>

<p>While Gillywulf and Valk do not discuss combating specific harmful conventions from the original texts, both address conventions they notice in the large fandom community and fanfic genres. Gillywulf provides a specific example of critical uptake: her TLOK fanfic was a series of short vignettes — 400 vignettes in total — based on prompts offered by other fans. She specifically addresses two prompts: one that asks her to write about a teacher/student relationship and one that asks her to write a slavefic. Both genres are popular in fandoms. The teacher/student relationship imagines a sexual and intimate relationship between a teacher and student, while slavefics imagine a sexual and intimate relationship between a person enslaved and the person who enslaved them. Both genres fetishize the harmful power dynamics.</p>
<p>The critical uptake, here, is seamless and easy to trace. First, there is the general genres of slavefics and teacher/student relationships; then, there is the prompt genre in which one fan requests another fan to produce something; finally, there’s Gillywulf’s actual fic. She knows the conventions well, but instead of accepting the prompt, her fics actively resist these conventions because she “didn't want to contribute to it.” Instead of writing a conventional slavefic between Korra and Asami, Gillywulf imagines that Korra is enslaved by Asami’s father and Asami straight up refuses to accept her father’s “gift.” Instead, Asami promises to free Korra. There is no mention of a sexual relationship. For the teacher/student relationship fic, Gillywulf imagines Asami — the teacher — actively refusing Korra’s—the students’ — sexual advancements. In many teacher/student fics, the student usually initiates the relationship, almost attempting to placate the uncomfortable power dynamics; even if the teacher is hesitant at first, they wind up accepting the students’ advances. Several prompts after kept asking Gillywulf to expand on this story, and she complied, reimaging Korra as a recent college graduate, rather than Asami’s current student.</p>
<p>Valk also discusses fan genre conventions that trouble them, specifically the “incredily heteronormative” conventions in GOT fanfics. Valk points out how the romance genre — specifically romance fics depicting Jaime’s and Brienne’s relationship — usually celebrates traditional gender roles. Valk says, “Just their gender roles and Brienne being vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.” One of the reasons Valk chose to write their fanfic, which reimagines Jaime (canonically cis male) as exploring his gender identity, to challenge these heteronormative conventions, or as Valk said “so I wrote my own instead.”</p>
<p>Finally, while many of the critical uptakes involve the authors challenging a particular convention they find troubling, both Kittya Cullen and Aria discuss the importance of fiction and fandoms to reshape readers’ perspectives and engage them politically. Aria says, “there's a study I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't convince them, but if you tell stories you can.” Aria’s fiction centers storytelling for the purpose of reaching and convincing others. Her uptake of original texts and fanfic genres are explicitly to engage others’ critical thinking. Kittya Cullen expresses a similar reason for writing and reading fiction, explaining that one of her goals is “how can [she] better represent experiences of people in the world?” Aria and Kittya explicitly state these motivations that drive their critical writing and uptakes, but these motivations to reshape the world and readers’ perspectives linger through every author’s responses.</p>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
         I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
         convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
         arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then I wrote a piece called [inaudible 00:05:42], which was sort of like a revisiting
         of what does... I guess it was actually about immigration, it's just I never really
         ever got around to doing a piece about immigration system, but somebody had a bad
         take about immigration in America in a piece of fanfic and I was like, "God, that's
         a really bad understanding of that friend. That is utopian and wrong."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
         very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
         you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
         original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
         through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
         and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
         with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
         get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
         you.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was coming into my own politically, I was becoming my own political individual in
         a way I hadn't been before. Like I had politics, but this is around the time that
         I'm really radicalized, and just me engaging with those contexts.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
         a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
         different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
         in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
         and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
         looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I was under the impression, reading or engaging with this text, I came away with
         this feeling like the Northern Water Tribe is somewhat... very different from the
         rest of the world, and there are ways that it plays as... I don't know if it was textual
         or sort of fan-driven more, but I remember coming away with this feeling that there
         is a marginalized subjectivity in the Northern Water Tribe. And so telling this story
         about difference in culture, and we'll get to... I'll get to Korra's upbringing a
         little bit later, because you're going to ask about 10 minutes later about Korra's
         upbringing. But I want to... Basically that I think Korra's upbringing is particularly
         reflective of that culture, yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I come away from Korra feeling like, "This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy
         that there's not homophobia in a world with gender in the like weird way that... In
         ways that still reflect our I think gender and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the
         way that we have a sense of gender. Big, capital G Gender. And so I thought like,
         "What does it mean to have culture in the context of... What does it mean to be a
         cosmopolitan city where... There's both a degree of marginalization for like the Northern
         Water Tribe closing... Not so much that rules that are really intended to enforce
         gender norms are going to be there. And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a
         different understanding of gender in context," yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
         progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
         man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
         and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
         said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
         understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
         woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
         This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
         institution itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So to me, Hiroshi's both a man that would destroy his children for the things he believes,
         and in some sense for his own power. But also a man who genuinely is providing aid
         and comfort and resources for fighting for what he views as liberation, and that liberation's
         probably genuine at some level. I think it's fair to say that there is a political
         bender-like supremacy at the beginning. I mean there is, we know there's a bender
         supremacy at the beginning of The Legend of Korra. And so that's how I understand
         Hiroshi.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to give a sense of what is the politics of the Northern Water Tribe? And
         I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water Tribe,
         or is not criminalized anymore. Also I wanted to say this is a different relationship.
         But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give
         up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I know what our reactionary politics is like, I think I'd start around the
         time that Kuvira is beginning to gain power. I'd write it as a story that talks about
         immigration, and talks about sweeping panic and fear that spill off of that. I'd probably
         talk about gender through those lenses, and I'd probably talk about humanity in a
         slightly more complex... I'd probably make it a story that... I'd probably both use
         modern messages to say that, I'd probably talk more about police state, and police
         state as endless spying networks where you don't know when you're being spied on and
         when you're not, and endless police states</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also, if you're looking at a subtext, my people they were like, "Oh yeah, I want to
         tell this story, I want to finish this story." And there's a degree to which it a
         queer reading, there's this political tendency to look at fiction and say, "I am going
         to tell the story you didn't." And so during the subtext period, you've already got
         these people who are basically being like, "Yo, I'm going to tell this story.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
         love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
         stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
         of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
         of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
         "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
         who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
         of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
         seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
         once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
         not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
         the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
         there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
         </li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
         super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
         of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
         relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
         should take five steps back, and let's just
         focus on these two.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
         it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
         press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
         slaves is super ... I didn't want to
         contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
         [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
         more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
         been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
         thing.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Especially with the prompts and setting boundaries like you
         mentioned earlier. It's writing what you want.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>To
         realizing that there was a community of people who were also interested in
         discussing how these shows and books and games et cetera were failing us, whether
         it
         was in terms of the content or the representation or just releasing new things like
         thought arcs that weren't followed through on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I completely forgot, there was a
         period where I would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because
         I
         don't do that anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment
         with writing and being critical of source materials and so on.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
         And in terms of relationships and love and so forth, it was I guess just coming back
         to what I like to explore in fiction, which is how people are interacting with each
         other, what it means for them. And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
         not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
         audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
         exploration. So I like to see for myself how their worth is existing within these
         relationships, what it means for them and what it can mean for the audience and so
         forth.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
         interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
         we
         kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
         thing about fandom
         and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
         either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
         enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
         in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
         world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
         through.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I think I'd actually forgotten about this until
         someone else had written it in their own fanfiction, which is part of what's so fun
         about reading fanfiction. There are all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on
         right away, but someone else mentions it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the
         world and look at it from a different angle.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
         show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
         just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
         not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
         female-female relationships as well, because a lot of the media already does a lot
         of
         the male-female exploration. And a lot of the purpose of fandom
         is to sort of explore beyond what we're just given.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to actually put some Game
         of Thrones content on those tags to begin with because back when I was writing it,
         there wasn't a lot really going for it. LGBT fanfics, yeah sure, but
         gender fluid and gender
         related things, it wasn't really there.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Like, where is this content that
         should be out there because it's in the books and why is no one taking this up and
         writing about it?</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
         them being intimate, but it was all
         very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
         vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
         I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
         own instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, it's depressingly small. I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
         less fanfic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
         unique friendship/relationship</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I would almost want to just write fic out of
         spite.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
         of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
         That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
         delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
         Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
         away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
         one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
         fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
         of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
         if I was a former slave. The one thing I
         would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
         in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
         into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
         anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
         like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
         underused character.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
         better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
         they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
         would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23].</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
         agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
         dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
         that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
         Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
         we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
         that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
         her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
         supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
         that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
         beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
         thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And like she says in the fic even
         if I get bit by a lizard-lion or I starve, that's my choice. But it won't be going
         back
         to a ruined Winterfell to marry a legitimized bastard.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It doesn't matter if it's to save my life. Even if you
         said that okay, "This is the only thing you can do to survive," at this point, she's
         run. She's re-discovered her strength. She's
         done something that she didn't think she could do. She got away
         for a time. So, at this point she's just like, "No, I can't do it. I won't do it."
         That was kind of that whole, what that
         episode was about was Sansa really re-discovering herself, and what she could
         do.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
         Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
         without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
         something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
         times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
         I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
         to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
         think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
         sentiment.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
         seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
         woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
         anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
         back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
         Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
         slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
         she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
         jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
         great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
         I've seen it before.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's a smile of, I
         can't think of the word, but being resigned to my fate. And if this is it, then this
         is it. And like I say, she recognizes in Cersei the same evil that she saw in
         Astapor where she's kind of like, "No, you
         would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
         think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
         better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
         are not. You are exactly like them." And in the end, she kind
         of wants to let her know. It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
         that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me. I see exactly what
         you are.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Like I
         said, as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
         be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
         be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself. Kind of like, I hate to use the
         comparison, but if you ever get out of a really bad relationship, and you're just
         like, "No, never again. I know the signs. I will never let that happen to me again."
         And for her of course it's more extreme,
         from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
         decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
         getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
         found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
         myself.</li>

<h2>Uptake: Canon Compliant</h2>
<div class="interview-search-analysis">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> When a fan celebrates and follows a particular event or character in the original source material (<a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/jwa/vol3/messina.pdf">Messina, 2019</a>). AThe term “canon compliant” comes from a popular “Additional Tag” used on AO3 when authors share that their fanfic follow canon. All fanfiction is canon compliant in that it follows from a source material. However, fan communities can vary in the degree to which they allow writers within the community to deviate from the origin source, i.e., the canon. Canon compliant uptakes may include writing a canonical relationship or continuing a canonical plot point. In other words, writers extend an existing story, rather than revising or changing the original character relationships or plots.</p>
<p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 31</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Canon compliant uptakes emerge when fans love something in the original text and want to replicate or build upon it in their uptake. Both Aria and Gillywulf use the word “excited” to express the affective relationship between the fan writer, the canonical material, and the fanfic the writer produces.</p>
<p>In TLOK, when Asami and Korra’s budding romance — and therefore their bisexuality — is confirmed canon in the last minute of the show, the fandom erupted with excitement and produced numerous fanfics using the “canon compliant” tag (more about this can be found in “<a href="{{ url_for('ffd_numbers_tlok') }}">Fandoms by Numbers</a>”). Aria, while reviewing some of the larger tagging trends, pointed out the large increase of “canon compliant” and “canon queer relationship” tags the series finale aired. Tagging practices, such as “canon compliant,” are a method for fan writers to signal to potential readers the different genre conventions and/or content that their piece contains.</p>
<p>Although canon compliant material was found in both fandoms analyzed, the GOT fanfic authors focused more on capturing particular dynamics — cultural and relationship — and characters in their canon compliant uptakes. While Dialux’s, Valk’s, and Writegirl’s pieces do not fall under the “canon compliant” genre — Dialux and Valk are alternate universes and Writegirl is canon divergent, fix-it fics — they make particular choices in their writing that mirror the canonical text. By pulling particular conventions from the original fantasy genre, these writers demonstrate how conventions span across different genres. For example, Dialux believes the regional and cultural tensions in GOT between the North and King’s Landing are similar to those between the Rajput and a Mughal in 16th century India, as depicted in the historical film <cite>Jodhaa Akbar</cite>. Her piece revolves around these regional, cultural, and religious tensions; she takes up conventions of how to represent cultural difference from two different genres and uses them in a third genre — her racebent, alternate universe fic.</p>
<p>Valk and Writegirl also bring in particular canon compliant choices into their non-canonical fics. Valk centers the tense canonical relationship between Jaime and his father in the original text, and brings that tension into their fic. And even though Writegirl’s fix-it fics reimagine the canon, she wants to make sure her readers can “they can really see [her fic] sliding into canon.” For her, this means also retaining characters’ voices and perspectives to ensure they are not OOC, or “out of character.”</p>
<p>While choosing to mirror particular characters, relationships, and dynamics in a fic is not necessarily a genre in of itself, there are clear expectations in fandoms that fanfics will mirror the canon in character voice and action, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Fanfic writers’ choice to follow canonical details and dynamics is part of fanfic genre expectations, and therefore a form of canon compliant uptake.</p>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
         there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
         feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
         a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
         but it's good.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon
         compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant,"
         as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant
         sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense
         to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a
         story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine
         that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on
         what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now.
         That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories
         that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I imagine that it's because... It makes sense to tell a friendship story with characters
         who are already very close friends, and characters who are becoming close friends.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I mean, canon queer relationship is more common because there is canon queer relationship.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>because it looks to me here that what you're seeing is a movement from seeing the
         word girlfriend in a context of a text that's about a set of texts about relationships
         in a more heterosexual perspective, in a story about women. Because it looks to me
         that this is a story that, if you see jealous there, that looks like I'm looking at
         a piece that's from Korra's point of view. But then if I'm looking at boyfriend, I'm
         also thinking about Korra and Mako.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, of course, you have the Targaryen
         colors, which are black, which are mourning colors according to the Western
         culture. And all of it kind of comes together. And, of course,
         Rajput culture is known for its red, its vibrant, blood red. And obviously, that's
         a
         Targaryen color.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But within this particular fic, as I said earlier, I
         really wanted to already have that tension. Especially that religious tension between
         Jon and
         Sansa. And have that difference, where both of them and neither of them are
         willing to compromise on that.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the regional tensions, I think, are already
         there in the canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, I mean, we don't know if she relies more on
         her religion because she left her homeland, and came to the North. And just
         wanted some desperate way, something to rely on that's her family, or that
         reminded her of home. But to me, at least, I can imagine, especially the actual
         Jodhaa, going to Akbar's Islamic court. And basically being all alone, and not
         having very many allies. And finding some sort of a solace in her religion of
         Hinduism.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
         very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
         queer
         characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
         go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
         their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
         situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And
         okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
         notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
         figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
         she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
         Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
         things stand out immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even in the modern drabbles, or the
         other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
         she can access that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
         gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
         age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
         she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
         life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
         all the time.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, it's kind of just how I always
         imagined her parents were just going to always be there for her. And we do see that
         in season three, where she's immediately going to bat for them and each
         other.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I just tried to stay true to that, I guess, in some
         regard, as far as her relationship went.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, for that chapter, I want to say, like everything
         else in the collection, it was a prompt, but it was something that I didn't want to
         ham-fist it, because Korra's definitely, she's
         traumatized. We see that more than once,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
         though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
         for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
         was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
         possible love interests.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Korrasami's canon. That's
         what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
         up to that point, there really hadn't been
         a whole lot of huge representation for female ships.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
         see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
         god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
         have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And also on being canon-compliant,
         but still ... I was working in an area where there was nothing for canon yet. I'm
         assuming that with the comics now, we'll get more information on that regard. But
         at
         the time, there was nothing in that area. So I wanted it to be known that it was
         still within canon's bounds, but there were going to be things being explored that
         weren't articulated in canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted
         to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
         in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
         that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
         reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
         very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
         and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted something similar, but would still
         make me feel like that, but wanted to make it more intimate and feel like it was
         still just as opening, but with actions and not just with words.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
         I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
         outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
         really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
         to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a very hard time
         getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
         motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
         are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
         that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
         top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because one thing as a writer that will pull me completely out of a story is if
         there is a colloquialism that should not belong. Or if
         you're using words, and I'm like, okay, I've never heard that word used on the show,
         so now you've just dropped a bomb in the middle of a wedding cake, and there's cake
         everywhere. It just pulls me out.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
         the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
         so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
         Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
         and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But I can
         see, especially in Season Five, and Six, and Seven, where you see Jon Snow, Sansa
         Stark, because these two characters kind of get back together in the show. When
         they're together, you can see their dynamic in everything else. And they look good
         together. That's always a good thing. It's always big when it comes to shipping, who
         looks good with who.</li>

<h2>Uptake: Canon Resistant</h2>
<div class="interview-search-analysis">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors discuss a canon resistant uptake, which is when a fan actively “resists both the implicit and explicit canonical choices made in the original cultural material” (<a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/jwa/vol3/messina.pdf">Messina, 2019</a>). This may include writing about a non-canonical relationship, identity bending, or reimagining an alternative plot point.</p>
<p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 19</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The canon resistant uptakes demonstrated in the interviews often begin with the writers’ affective responses to a particular moment, choice, or character from the original show. These affective responses may be negative or positive depending on the author’s interpretation of the show, choices made in the show, and the author’s positionality.</p>
<p>Several authors cite they were unhappy with certain choices from the original show that drove them to take their fics in a canon divergent direction. Aria expressed discomfort with the representation of PTSD and trauma in TLOK; she argues the show does not necessarily reflect the reality of living with trauma. In TLOK, Korra recovers from her physical wounds and seems to be able to move past her PTSD, yet Aria points out that many people who experience PTSD have to learn to live with it instead of recovering from it. Writegirl was unhappy with the direction the GOT show writers chose, specifically inconsistencies and plot holes; she specifically uses the phrase “irksome.” She talks about her choice to reimagine Sansa’s storyline, claiming Sansa “suffered a little bit of character assassination.”</p>
<p>Of course, even with their unhappiness, Aria, Writegirl, and the other authors love the source material, as they most likely would not be writing fanfiction for it otherwise. There are other authors, such as Gillywulf, who love specific details or characters in the show that they wanted to capture in their canon resistant uptakes. Gillywulf, for example, began to write romantic Korra/Asami (Korrasami) fanfiction before their romance became part of the official show. Choosing to pair a couple together that is not paired on the original show is a form of canon resistant uptake. Gillywulf talks specifically about wlw (women loving women) ships in fandoms and how fans often imagine characters as developing or having intimate relationships. She says, “ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon.” Gillywulf’s original choice to write Korrasami fanfiction came because she liked the idea of Korra and Asami as a couple.</p>
<p>Valk also expresses a love for Jaime and Brienne’s characters in GOT. Jaime/Brienne are the most popular ship in GOT according to the <a href="{{ url_for('ffd_numbers_got') }}">GOT fandom by numbers data analysis</a>, and they do have a romance on the show. Yet, Valk chooses to view Brienne and Jaime differently than many GOT fanfic writers. They reimagine Jaime, who is canonically male, as wanting to explore his gender through the use of makeup and other forms of aesthetic expression. Brienne, Jaime’s roommate in the fanfic, helps Jaime put on his makeup and supports him in his gender exploration and expression. While Valk’s entire piece is canon resistant, they particularly hone in on why they reimagine Brienne as a supportive, stable friend to Jaime; Valk reimagines Brienne as “more comfortable in her skin” than she is in GOT, potentially due to a lack of social forces pushing her to conform to particular gender roles. Valk’s choices in reimagining both Brienne and Jaime’s characters are not only canon resistant, but also resist larger trends in the Brienne/Jaime shipping fandom.</p>
<p>These different examples — the canon resistant uptakes inspired by unhappiness or excitement from an original text’s direction — reveal how canon resistant uptakes are forms of love letters to the original show, but love letters that are written from different positionalities and ways of viewing the world than the original show.</p>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
         context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
         very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
         you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
         original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
         through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
         and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
         with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
         get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
         you.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
         clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
         Jon is raised a Targaryen.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>A Jon who would grow up in a Targaryen
         court would look very different in the Targaryen [inaudible
         00:53:09] than with a Targaryen father.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the thing is, as much as he looked like Ned on a physical level, Ned is not the
         Ned that we see in canon. Because he's very much a person who has been basically
         warring for however Jon has been alive.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, actually, Aishwarya Rai, who plays Jodhaa,
         does not have brown eyes. She has hazel eyes.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But Sansa, she
         didn't have any such love interests. I mean, obviously, I was shipping her with Jon
         and everything. But there was no actual canonical basis for that on any
         level.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
         been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
         And maybe, I think,
         during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
         different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
         strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>They wanted to be friends first, but they were so good together that I wanted to be
         able to
         sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Obviously, there's always going to be people who say,
         "I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
         care whether or not they necessarily gel." I'm sure there's
         people ... I feel like I went back a million years ago and looked at the first
         Korrasami fics, just out of curiosity, to see when they were published, and I'm sure
         that they were like episode one, because it's just what people do, and it's great.
         Ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
         Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
         because obviously they wouldn't be having as
         much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
         considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
         day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
         from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
         versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
         wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
         identity. But there would definitely be some push
         back, but how would that change based on the setting?
         I made her a little bit more comfortable in
         her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
         shoulder for Jaime
         who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
         well.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
         Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
         Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
         no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
         brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
         thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
         wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
         series, the first one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
         know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
         And
         it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
         What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
         And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
         and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
         the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
         that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
         world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
         would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
         maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
         how I got into that.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
         written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
         okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
         alone.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But all of a suddenly, this particular set of characters is no longer in the
         picture. So how does that affect everything else? How does Daenerys Targaryen deal
         with a kingdom that is pretty much united with a war hero still on the throne?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
         think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
         little bit of character assassination.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted to kind of show a Sansa who was still herself.
         A Sansa who was willing to not listen to him, who
         understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
         manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
         only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
         run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
         ends are." That's kind of where that idea came from.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She was
         supposed to kind of get lost in the trees, and they were supposed to find her. But
         I
         thought that was a little bit ignominious for her. So then I remembered, Oh,
         Nimeria's wolf pack. I was like, they haven't used that in the show at all, so why
         not?</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
         divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
         want to get blasted on that one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It doesn't matter if it's to save my life. Even if you
         said that okay, "This is the only thing you can do to survive," at this point, she's
         run. She's re-discovered her strength. She's
         done something that she didn't think she could do. She got away
         for a time. So, at this point she's just like, "No, I can't do it. I won't do it."
         That was kind of that whole, what that
         episode was about was Sansa really re-discovering herself, and what she could
         do.</li>

<h2>Uptake: Implicit/Explicit</h2>
<div class="interview-search-analysis">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors discuss an implicit-explicit uptake, which is when a fan “analyzes the subtext of the show and makes the subtext explicit in their fanfictions” (<a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/jwa/vol3/messina.pdf">Messina, 2019</a>). This may include writing from another characters’ perspective or exploring a romantic relationship that may be inferred.</p>
<p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 25</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Fan author’s implicit-explicit uptakes are often motivated by them wanting to explore a particular dynamic, character, or plotline in further detail while also making assumptions based on information provided by the text — also known as interpreting the subtext. Writegirl, Valk, and Kittya each expressed curiosity about a particular character, wanting to explore that character further. Writegirl, for example, wonders what “life would have been like for [Missandei],” and uses this as motivation for her fanfic. This is an implicit-explicit uptake because Writegirl uses all her knowledge of both the show and the novels in order to make assumptions about Missandei’s backstory. Valk writes in the alternate universe genre, which is typically a canon resistant uptake.</p>
<p>However, similar to Writegirl, Valk still wants to explore Jaime’s character based on their knowledge of the show, but in another universe that is not GOT. They point specifically to the “residual toxic masculinity” of Jaime’s character, both in the show and in their fanfic. Finally, Kittya decides to write about Asami because “I like to see how the characters are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.” This again points to an implicit-explicit uptake of a character in that Kittya follows the plot arc of the show and stays as true to the show as possible, while still exploring a character who Kittya believes received little attention on the show. For each of these implicit-explicit uptakes, the authors reveal both their intimate knowledge of the text as well as their ability to more deeply analyze particular characters based on details from the show.</p>
<p>Often implicit-explicit uptakes occur when a fanfic author is interested in learning more about a character, implicit-explicit uptakes also occur when an author makes assumptions about the original text’s universe or relationships between two characters based on details. Aria describes several choices she made in her fanfic based on assumptions from the show, such as how different cultures in TLOK understood gender and sexuality, a character probably not knowing how to cook, and another character being a “bourgeoisie radical.” Aria’s analysis of the different cultures in TLOK demonstrates both her knowledge of the show as well as an understanding of cultural difference.</p>
<p>In reflecting on often used implicit-explicit uptakes in fandoms, several authors point to popular relationship pairings in fanfics as representative of fans reading the subtext of the original text. Valk, for example, wonders why there are not more Sansa/Margaery fics as their potential romance is “literally right here,” referring to the subtext of the show. Dialux also points to a potential romance between Jon and Sansa based on the trailer for GOT’s season six, when fans began speculating about Jon and Sansa’s relationship. Similarly, Gillywulf addresses the Korra/Asami fics written before the show confirmed their relationship was canonical. Specifically, Gillywulf points to a moment between Korra and Asami in the third season after Korra was injured. She says, “Asami looked the most scared out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, ‘That's a little gayer than it maybe should be,’ that sort of look. So, a lot of people took that and decided to go with it.” Gillywulf points to fans’ abilities to analyze the subtext and draw particular assumptions, then write fanfics about these assumptions. Based on simply Asami’s facial expression, Gillywulf and others performed implicit-explicit uptakes.</p>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I was under the impression, reading or engaging with this text, I came away with
         this feeling like the Northern Water Tribe is somewhat... very different from the
         rest of the world, and there are ways that it plays as... I don't know if it was textual
         or sort of fan-driven more, but I remember coming away with this feeling that there
         is a marginalized subjectivity in the Northern Water Tribe. And so telling this story
         about difference in culture, and we'll get to... I'll get to Korra's upbringing a
         little bit later, because you're going to ask about 10 minutes later about Korra's
         upbringing. But I want to... Basically that I think Korra's upbringing is particularly
         reflective of that culture, yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I come away from Korra feeling like, "This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy
         that there's not homophobia in a world with gender in the like weird way that... In
         ways that still reflect our I think gender and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the
         way that we have a sense of gender. Big, capital G Gender. And so I thought like,
         "What does it mean to have culture in the context of... What does it mean to be a
         cosmopolitan city where... There's both a degree of marginalization for like the Northern
         Water Tribe closing... Not so much that rules that are really intended to enforce
         gender norms are going to be there. And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a
         different understanding of gender in context," yeah.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Asami probably can't like cook...because I think it's either canonical or in fanon,
         and I kind of like that, because I like the notion that... I like the notion that
         someone who's very good at some things, but just not good at other things.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that this is a piece that comes from a weird part of what I understood about
         that world. To me, Korra grows up in a compound with people who are older than her,
         who aren't likely to tell her the truth about things. Because the White Lotus is an
         organization of people who are fundamentally keeping her apart. And I remember being
         like, "Oh, these folks are not going to tell a child about queer sexuality." Particularly
         sexuality is a hard topic, you grow up in that kind of compound in a world where queer
         identities are looked down on, you're going to come away with this very strange view
         about that. And you might just be told nothing.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
         her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
         Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
         is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
         dress herself.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>In the context of this piece, a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois
         radical is that I'm not going to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really
         have a sense of class politics at the time, or have the beginnings of that study.
         That's only beginning to be born</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also, if you're looking at a subtext, my people they were like, "Oh yeah, I want to
         tell this story, I want to finish this story." And there's a degree to which it a
         queer reading, there's this political tendency to look at fiction and say, "I am going
         to tell the story you didn't." And so during the subtext period, you've already got
         these people who are basically being like, "Yo, I'm going to tell this story.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
         I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
         make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
         heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
         fandoms. And I think that's probably because we don't have one
         main character and one side character that's like the sidekick to the main
         character, both of them being male. You don't have that here.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because
         I know that a lot of people had mentioned that it was at the beginning of Season
         Six. Like, when a couple of trailers came out regarding Sansa meeting up with
         somebody in the North. It was kind of staging with Ramsay Bolton. That Jon Snow and
         Sansa Stark fandom kind of really took off. And it was the beginning of Season Six
         that it really, properly emerged. So, it would be interesting to see if there is a
         cookie cutter point that you can identify like, this is where the general public
         kind of suddenly said, "Oh, this is the moment."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
         only get a certain amount of them in canon.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>At the end of season three, we saw that development and
         we saw, especially during Korra's fight with Zaheer, Asami looked the most scared
         out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her
         recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, "That's a little gayer than it maybe
         should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
         of people took that and decided to go with it, especially since
         the relationship was [inaudible 01:00:21], whether or not ...
         Again, and at that time, we didn't know the writer's intention, so it was just
         everybody, or at least Korrasami fans, picking
         up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
         so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
         happen."</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I kind of wanted to see that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular,
         and this was surprising for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I
         never really remember to think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like
         there was this big gap available to us for exploration.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So I kind of wanted to explore that and see how
         Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for me I like to see how the characters
         are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to
         them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And also on being canon-compliant,
         but still ... I was working in an area where there was nothing for canon yet. I'm
         assuming that with the comics now, we'll get more information on that regard. But
         at
         the time, there was nothing in that area. So I wanted it to be known that it was
         still within canon's bounds, but there were going to be things being explored that
         weren't articulated in canon.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Whereas, for
         Asami, Asami didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have
         anyone. So she went back to someone, I
         guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
         for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
         act of violence ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore
         that. It's just fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow
         still find a way to circle back around to the people who have hurt
         them.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>You never
         really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
         to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
         with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
         wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>from the source material where I wanted to kind of
         explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
         because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
         as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I just find their relationship in
         canon to be so interesting because it was one of
         the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
         pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
         surprised.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
         he always had a very strange affinity, but
         like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
         loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
         of view.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think he definitely
         is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
         means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
         it.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That's definitely
         something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
         of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
         would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
         more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
         me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
         anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
         all of that.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
         them, but I
         don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
         just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
         literally right here.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was my take on the scene where Brienne and Pod meet her in the tavern, where
         she seems to be at first a little surprised, a little relieved, and then you kind
         of
         see her shut down a bit.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But in my mind, I
         didn't think she didn't want it because she didn't necessarily trust Brienne, it was
         more because Peter would never let her go. Even if this person said, "I'm going to
         help you," he would never allow that, because he
         wants control of her, and that is something that she realizes, because she's not
         an idiot. She's seen this man in King's Landing, she sees how
         he operates. She sees how he operates in the Eyrie. If he doesn't have total control
         of her, he's not going to allow it. And the best way to do that would be to get rid
         of these two people. And she doesn't want anyone to die for her. So that was kind
         of
         my read on that situation.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So yeah, [Missandei]'s such an interesting character. There's
         so much about her that could be written that isn't written. I just kind of wanted
         to
         investigate a little bit. What would life have been like for this character?</li>

<h2>Uptake: Fan Practices</h2>
<div class="interview-search-analysis">
   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p><strong>Definition</strong>: When fan authors discuss a fan practice uptake, which is when a fan takes up fan genre practices in the fan community, such as engaging with fan genre conventions or implementing specific tagging practices.</p>
   <p><strong>Number of Codes</strong>: 30</p>
   <p><strong>Analysis</strong>: When sharing fan practice uptakes, the fan author's point to larger conventions in fan communities that often occur across fandoms, such as similar practices in both GOT and TLOK fandoms. Of course, these conventions still engage with the original text, but these uptakes are specific to fan communities. Reading each fan authors’ transcripts show shared discourse, such as words like “fanon,” “shipping,” and “AU.” There is a specific, shared discourse when discussing and participating in generic conventions, tagging practices, and other fandom activities.</p>
   <p>First, each author reflects on particular fanfic generic forms that are mainly found in fan communities and known by members across these communities. Dialux’s fanfic is a great example. She wrote her fic based on a request from another fan. The fan wanted “historical AU, alternate universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.” This stream of suggestions, which Dialux was able to accommodate, demonstrates shared discourse and an understanding of common fanfic generic conventions. Aria also points to the difference between fanfic generic conventions and “literary” genres; she says she used to label her pieces as angst or fluff, but recently began seeing her genre participation as separate from these fanfic genre conventions. Participating in and being able to recognize these generic forms demonstrates a shared fan practice; while fans engage and define these practices, they are enacting fan practice uptakes.</p>
   <p>Another form of fan practice uptakes are methods for discoverability and authors attempting to reach their audience, such as using hashtags or keywords depending on the platform. Since this project specifically looks at Archive of Our Own (AO3), the fan authors all discuss tagging practices on AO3. There are different author-selected categories for tagging, from the characters that appear in the author’s fanfic to additional tags the author can choose. Each of these tags can be used to search (include or exclude) while readers try to find their ideal fanfics. Tagging is a form of fan practices uptake in that authors need to know specific discourse and use this discourse to reach their audience. Kittya, for example, talks about how she did not understand tagging practices when she wrote her fanfic; she says, “ I wasn't quite sure what tags to use because I was still learning.” However, there is not one proper way to tag a fanfic. While there is a shared discourse, fans can also practice tagging in individual ways. As Gillywulf points out, some authors choose to write full sentences in the Additional Tags, rather than merely choosing a few key words that mirror fans’ shared discourse. While Gillywulf does not like to write sentence-long tags, this example demonstrates that there are particular expectations that fans often break or challenge in their uptake of fan practices.</p>
   <p>Understanding tagging as an uptake is important because the author is not only trying to originally reach their ideal audience, but their fanfic must follow through on the tag’s promise. If an author chooses the tag “Alternate Universe,” then their fic typically engages with AU generic conventions. Writegirl also signals how important tagging practices are, especially in the GOT fandom. She says some readers respond to the tags authors use and argue that they used incorrect tags; correcting authors’ tagging choices is another fan practices uptake. So not only are there expectations for particular discourse to be used when tagging, but the actual text must take up the tags’ promises and, if the text does not, readers may critique and potentially ostracize the author from the fandom.</p>
   <p>Another form of fan practice uptakes are fan-specific activities that occur in fan spaces. Dialux points to this in her motivation for writing fics. She participates in several fan community activities, such as the “Yuletide assignment” and the “Jonsa Exchange” (Jonsa is Jon/Sansa romantic fanfics). These activities vary based on the fandom, platform, and generic form. Often, though, they are large prompts that invite fans to create art, from illustrations or fanfics. The “Jonsa Exchange,” for example, pairs authors together and they request different types of fics; as I mentioned previously, Dialux wrote her fic for this exchange based on another fan’s prompt. To participate in these activities is a form of fan practice uptakes, as fans are literally taking up the assignments and creating another generic form in response.</p>
   <p>Another example of fan-specific uptakes are fan translations, as Kittya discusses. Fans translate particular texts, such as a show or novel for other fans to make the text accessible. Kitya used fan translations after she moved to North America and wanted to continue watching Hindi shows; she could not speak Hindi fluently, so she relied on these fan translations. Finally, fans often inspire each other through their art, and other fans will specifically take up their art. Gillywulf provides several examples of this. One fan artist drew several pictures based on Gillywulf’s fanfic; Gillywulf’s last chapter in her fanfic is inspired by another fan artists’ painting; and Gillywulf specifically mirrors writing practices one of her favorite fanfic authors utilizes in their fanfics. The creativity flourishing in fan communities demonstrates how fans take up fan generic conventions, inspiring and forming bonds with each other.</p>

   <h3>Quotes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>People are like, "Oh..." When people talk about RWBY, the way they talk about the
         White Fang is the way they talk about radical politics. And I don't know if they realize
         it, but I always get really annoyed, because this is like bad political theory. It's
         very normal American political theory, but it's also bad. It's very much like, "Oh,
         there's no justification for violence," it's like, "I don't agree."</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also I think it's when fiction ends, it does draw people who are like, "Oh, I want
         to write more on this subject, I want to play with these concepts again." There's
         also a distinct un-ended-ness</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad.
         But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want
         to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want
         to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that!
         I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.[inaudible 00:47:08]
         what are other ways we can imagine it?</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And that creates fanon, which means you get this whole long space of people being
         like, "Oh yeah, I am writing about this content of fanon in this alternate universe,
         I'm going to write a piece about a radio show</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of [inaudible 00:47:39], some
         of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion that comes out of that. So
         I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and I think that it's liberating
         for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I don't know, I don't know if I'd use the fluff and angst tags anymore, just because
         I don't talk about my literature in those terms as much anymore, as I used to, but...
         Largely because nobody...You don't use those tags as much anymore in my view, like
         we don't talk about... Those are very much Fanfiction.net-y terms that pulled over,
         I don't see them as I used to.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong> a [inaudible 00:57:08] of the audience that come later are less interested in acknowledging
         or talking about race. Given this is a proportion, I don't know if [inaudible 00:57:24]
         but more people as a fandom and those few people aren't interested in talking about
         race in ways that people who had been there before were, and those people who were
         there before continued to talk about race, or if there is an effectively gentrifying
         mmoment that a white fandom comes in, pushes out a fandom of color. I don't know how
         this tag is used, so I would feel hesitant to say something definite. But I find that
         a little bit troublesome.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>The context is basically just, yeah, things you would expect people would say on a
         date, things you'd expect people to do on a date, things that writers do when they
         run out of words, like chuckle.</li>
      <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also this more mature understanding of a relationship, seeing their partner as a dork
         versus like, seeing them as cute. And obviously you see your partner is cute for a
         long time after you start dating, that... Viewing someone as a dork is a more developed
         sense of what a relationship is.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I've also recently published work in Fleabag, which
         was one of the fandoms that I had to write for for my Yuletide assignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
         the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
         Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
         film."</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
         person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
         universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
         view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
         you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
         of
         view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
         what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
         more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
      <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
         because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
         other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
         fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
         particular tag.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
         a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
         always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
         at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
         art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
         it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
         person's mind."</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
         get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
         distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
         be
         able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
         somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
         something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
         looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
         and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
         is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
         it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
         since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
         until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
         a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
         decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
         this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
         case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
         Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
         bit.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>It was
         partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
         Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City,</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a writer, whose name I always mess up. I want to
         say it's coeurdastronaute. They do a lot of Clarke and Lexa
         stuff, but she sets the scene super well with like, "Here's the sky. Here's the
         roads. Here's the this," and I tried to emulate that.</li>
      <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's okay to learn from other writers. Like I said
         with coeurdastronaute, everything she writes is like, "I'm in
         love with this. It's great. How can I maybe write something similar to that? What
         parts can I take from this that I want to emulate?"</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I got into forums and fans would
         translate for those of us who didn't speak Hindi. And obviously
         people would answer questions if you asked because you couldn't get everything in
         the translations or the summaries. And during that time, we would talk about the
         plot of the show, what the characters were doing, where we were expecting things to
         go at that time. It was just a lot of the basic things at fandom.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess you can say it was a
         nudge to move from passive consumption to active consumption.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But also the fics I had read after the
         show had finished seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ...
         Obviously, it was a really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had
         happened in the gap years that they hadn't shown us for Korra.</li>
      <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Partly, I wasn't quite sure what tags to use
         because I was still learning.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, definitely when it comes to trying to write it
         realistically as well, but the banter back and forth was very difficult. I read a
         lot of fanfic where it can be very stalkish and when I think about it and I think
         about someone saying it out loud, I just like cringe. My face caves in.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think I would want to go
         more into maybe tagging some of the triggers maybe now a days because back then
         there wasn't as much of a discussion around it. Now a days, you have more of a
         discussion around what bigger tags to put in to help people avoid it for instance.
         Now that AO3 has updated its tagging system to include and exclude.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Sandor and Sansa, I will say that I like their ship name
         as San-San. I do understand the whole
         like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
         romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
         just write a Nora Roberts novel." I'd so read her books if I
         wanted to. I don't need to read them here.</li>
      <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I had some really bad, some
         really heated discussions with a friend on my dashboard on Twitter. We just did that,
         like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
         and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
         interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
         dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
         front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
         interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
         not try and put this away. Yeah, it was a whole mess. People
         came out in droves, angry for different reasons.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then people would be like, "Oh, your fanfic is
         this like this one, so why don't you go read this fanfic?" It kind of was a jumping
         off point for me.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
         delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
         Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
         away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
         one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
         fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
         of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
         if I was a former slave. The one thing I
         would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
         in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
         into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
         anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
         like to see a bit more of that in <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> fanfiction. She's really an
         underused character.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
         thing I noticed about the <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> fandom, because I did just kind of jump
         in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
         and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
         unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
         me
         try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
         There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
         improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
         "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
         People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
         right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
         never know. I think my
         characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
         "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
         it may be out of character."</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
         divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
         want to get blasted on that one.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
         the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
         so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
         Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
         and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>
      <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
         active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
         especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
         and
         putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>
