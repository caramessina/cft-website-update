<h2>TLOK Fanfiction Publishing Trends</h2>

    <p>The top graph shows the publishing trends of <cite>The Legend of Korra</cite> (TLOK) fanfiction published on <cite>Archive of Our Own</cite> across the years, from the first published fic in 2011 to approximately July 2015. The top graph shows how many fics were published on specific weeks up until July 2015, several months after the series finale aired.</p>
    <p>Publishing activity in TLOK fluctuates often. The first spike of publishing activity is around June 2012, when TLoK first aired. Fans actually had content to work with then, which explains the uptick in publishing rates. The next spike in fan engagement is around February 2013. TLoK was originally supposed to be one season, which explains why there is no continuity in the narratives across all four season.</p>
    <p>However, season 2 did not air until late 2013, so the spike in February 2013 may be because the show was announced to come back, again stirring excitement within the fan community. When season 2 actually aired in late 2013, fans engagement barely rose; this may be because season 2 was widely unpopular in TLOK fandom.</p>
    <p>The bottom graph zooms in on Seasons 3 and 4, which brought another larger spike of fan engagement. Season 3 aired June 2014, while season 4 aired October 2014 and finished in December 2014.</p>
    <p>The final graph shows publishing trends while Seasons 3 and 4 of TLOK were airing. What made seasons 3 and 4 so special was the writers' choices to develop Korra and Asami's relationship. Towards the end of season 3, Korra survives a battle and is left traumatized both physically and emotionally. While helping Korra get ready for a celebration, Asami puts her hand on Korra's and says "I want you to know that I’m here for you, if you ever want to talk, or - anything." Fans began to read into this interaction, seeing a new possible romance budding between Korra and Asami.</p>
    <p>Season 4–which aired from October to December 2013–continued a similar trajectory, dropping hints that Korra and Asami may see each other as more than friends. Fans picked up on this subtext, and the amount of fanfictions published spiked. Finally, at the end of Season 4 in December 2014, Korra and Asami's romance seemed to be confirmed canon. January 2015 brought the highest spike of fan engagements when almost 400 new fanfictions were written.</p>

<h2>Relationship and Romantic Data</h2>
<p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#relat-desc" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">Read the description of the "Relationship and Romantic Data" visualizations.
    </a>These descriptions are also available on the visualizations themselves.</p>
  <div class="collapse" id="relat-desc">
    <p>There are multiple screens in this visualization. First is relationship counts. Relationship categories show the general gender pairings represented in the fic. Seasons one, two, and arguably three depict only heterosexual relationships, so F/M (female/male) is the most popular relationship category pre-Korrasami.</p>
	<p>However, as the seasons continue, especially around season three, Korra and Mako's relationship falls apart, while Korra's relationship with Asami grows stronger. There is a huge uptick in F/F (female/female) relationship categories after Korra and Asami's relationship is confirmed canon, demonstrating the power this moment had over fans.</p>
  <p>While the previous graph demonstrated general trends in relationship categories according to gender, this visualization looks more in-depth at some of the most popular ships in TLoK fandom. These are the 10 most popular across the entire TLoK corpus.
	Take some time to explore these 10 most popular ships, or use the above search function titled "Relationship" to search for another ship. In total, you can explore the top 30 ships!</p>
  <p>These are the top 5 ships in the Pre-Korrasami corpus. Korra and Mako are the most popular ship; they are the main couple in the show, after all, so there are parallels between the show and the fandom.</p>
  <p>There are a few important arguments to be made from this visualization. First, canonical relationships--and therefore representation in cultural materials--do impact fan communities and how fans engage with texts. In the first few seasons, Korra/Mako may have been popular because they were the lead couple on the show, but the act of them being the lead couple of the show may have also invited mainly a heterosexual fan audience to engage with the show. Second, even though Korra/Mako is the most popular ship, Korra/Asami fanfics were still being published. Even if a fandom replicates heternormative narratives, there are still fans who challenge this exclusion. Not every fandom's shipping patterns directly mirror the show's canonical relationship; in fact, some of the most popular ships in certain cultural text are LGBTQ+ relationships that are not canon (such as the most used ship in My Hero Academia being two male characters who are not canonically in a relationship).The growing interest of Korra/Asami, even before there are any subtextual hints at their relationship, demonstrate the resilience of fans invested in LGBTQ+ narratives. Even when the Mako/Korra ship reigns over the canonical text and the fandom, the Korra/Asami ship sails on.</p>
  <p>Korra/Asami's ship (Korrasami) jumps in popularity in both the "subtextual-Korrasami" and "post-Korrasami" corpora. Not only that, but the rate of fanfics published also had a huge jump because of this fan investment in Korrasami. There are almost 1,000 more Korrasami fanfics published in the post-Korrasami fanfics than Mako/Korra fanfics published in the pre-Korrasami corpus (300), as displayed here.</p>
  <p>This jump both in fanfic publication numbers and the number of Korrasami fanfics published demonstrates the importance of LGBTQ+ representation in cultural texts, especially in fandoms. To have an bisexual relationship represented between two women in a children's cartoon in America had not been done before, and the excitement around this reveal resonated across the entire fandom. And this data spike captures that excitement.</p>

        <p>TLoK seasons 3 and 4 brought another spike in fan engagement. Season 3 aired in June 2014, while Season 4 aired in October 2014.</p>
        <p>What made seasons 3 and 4 so special was the writers' choices to develop Korra and Asami's relationship.

        <h2><cite>The Legend of Korra</cite> Popular Relationship Tags</h2>
        <p>While the previous graph demonstrated general trends in relationship categories according to gender, this visualization looks more in-depth at some of the most popular ships in TLoK fandom. These are not all the popular ships (for example, Varrick and Zhu Li is missing), but these have been chosen to demostrate changes in the fandom over time.</p>
        <p>In the earlier seasons (in the pre-Korrasami corpus), Korra and Mako are the most popular ship, as expected; they are the main couple in the show, after all. Even in later seasons, the Korra/Mako ship still appears. For example, in the post-Korrasami corpus, 121 fics publish with the Korra/Mako tag. Korra and Tahno (male) are another semi-popular ship; they were rivals in the show, and tension between may have capivated some of the fans.</p>
        <p>There are a few other semi-popular ships in the later seasons, particularly around season 4. Mako and Prince Wu (male) become more well-used as Mako acts as Wu's body guard. Korra and Kuvira (female) are another popular ship; similar to Korra and Tahno, Korra and Kuvira are rivals, but in the show Korra sees herself in Kuvira and empathizes with her pain. Fans pick up on this tension and explore their relationship further (jumping from only 5 fics who use the Korra/Kuvira tag to 63 fics.</p>
        <p>Finally, Korra and Asami's ship jumps in popularity around Season 3 and 4 (subtext-Korrasami corpus), demonstrating that fans were taking up the subtextual possibilities and reading into their interactions as potentially romantic. When the fans' readings were proven correct in the series finale, the amount of Korra/Asami fanfics skyrocketed (post-Korrasami corpus).</p>

    <img class="d-block" src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/tlok-additional-tags.png')}}" alt="A bargraph of some of the most popular additional tags across time, including fluff, romance, canon compliant, canon queer relationship, angst, femslash, and more. The bargraph shows the percetanges of these tags used compared to the rest of the tags in that corpus. ">
    <div class="carousel-caption">
        <h2><cite>The Legend of Korra</cite> Popular Additional Tags</h2>
        <p>Relationship tags are crucial for understanding a fandom, but so are the additional tags. Many of TLoK fanfiction additional tags stay the same across time. This visualization shows the percantage of a particular tag used in relation to the rest of the additional tags used in each corpus.</p>
        <p>For some of the most frequently used tags, like "fluff" and "angst," both tags that appear across fandoms, there are slight differences in their percentage of use across the three corpora.</p>
        <p>There is also a huge spike in "canon compliant" additional tags in the post-Korrasami corpus, which means the fanfic author is following the original text. This suggests again that fans were responding positively to the series finale and Korra and Asami's relationship.</p>
        <p>The additional tag "canon character of color" seemed to be used more frequently in the pre-Korrasami corpus, while it is less frequnt in the other two corpora. This may be because there was less of a need to mark up "canon character of color" as TLoK became more popular, thus normalizing a main character of color. Meanwhile, "canon queer relationship" as well as "canon queer character of color" (not dispalyed) appear in the post-Korrasami series finale.</p>

          <img class="d-block" src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/tlok-additional-tags-zoomed.png')}}" alt="A bargraph that looks at some of the most popular AO3 tags used in The Legend of Korra fanfics: smut, fluff, alternate universe, and angst.">
          <div class="carousel-caption">
            <h2>Popular <em>Archive of Our Own</em> Tags Used in TLoK Fanfics</h2>
            <p>The most glaring difference, though, is that fluff was used much less often in the earlier seasons than in the later seasons. In the post-Korrasami corpus, fluff became the most widely-used tag. Fluff indicates that the story is supposed to have a similar sensation to being "fluffy," in that it usually centers around warm-and-fuzzy feelings. Fluff is usually used in romantic stories to represent a cozy romance. Many of the fanfic writers may have used fluff as a response to the happy ending of TLoK–both happy in the sense that the show ended on a high note, but also happy in that a queer relationship was actually confirmed canon.</p>
            <p>The percentage of fanfics that used the additional tag "angst" also increases. Angst fics typically revolve around feelings of angst, including depression, anxiety, fear, and pain.
            <p>Romance is used fairly consistently, as romance is often a central focus in fanfiction. It is also often paired with other genre tags, such as angst and fluff. However, using the romance tag indicates to readers that the fic will heavily revolve around romance.</p>
            <p>Finally, smut is used less often in the post-Korrasami corpus as compared to the other corpora. Smut is an additional tag that implies written, explicit sex. Even though the number of fics skyrocketed in the post-Korrasami corpus and most of them revolved around Korra and Asami, smut was used less often, implying explicit sex was generally less of the authors' interest in writing their relationship and romance. While writing about sex, especially queer sex, is powerful, authors were more focused on the other aspects of relationships besides sex.</p>
