# Critical Fan Toolkit Website

The CFT website is currently down because Heroku, which was publishing the application, is currently going through changes. In order to still access the CFT, you can download this GitHub repository to your local computer and follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. 
2. Open your terminal
3. Navigate to where you downloaded the CFT file 
4. To ensure you have all the proper packages, run the command line ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. Get a local server running the command line ```$ python run.py```
6. Open the app by going to your browser and pasting the "Running on" URL (found in your terminal)
